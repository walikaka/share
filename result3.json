We estimated the vegetation dynamics using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and poverty with the rural per capita net income. Local indicator of spatial association and the space-time transition type of poverty were applied to identify spatial patterns of the poverty spatial distribution relationship and transition. Also, poverty, natural and ecological governance factors were assessed using the Geo-detector method to uncover the driving factors of karst vegetation. The results showed that vegetation increased significantly (p < 0.05) in karst NPDC (82.82%) and rocky desertification control counties (78.77%). The karst NPDC was significantly clustered. The hot spots of rural per capita net income changed from west and north (2000) to only north (2015) and cold spots changed from east and south (2000) to only south (2015). The rural per capita net income spatiotemporal transition was higher in 2000 than in 2015. We found a weak synergy between vegetation change and poverty type transition in 42.86% of the browning counties, 45.45% in the slowly greening counties, and 43.65% in stable greening counties. However, 57.50% of counties in the quick greening counties showed a tradeoff relationship with the poverty type transition.

We quantified spatiotemporal variations in SOC in three typical regions (Shuyang, Rugao, and Shanghai) in southeastern China during 1981-2011, by using geographically weighted regression (GWR), and explored the drivers with a geographical detector method. A total of 219 topsoil samples were collected in the three regions to measure the SOC in 2011, and a total of 109 SOC data for 1981 were obtained from the soil survey reports of Shuyang, Rugao, and Shanghai, which involved in the database of the second national soil survey of China. The results showed that the mean SOC contents in 2011 were 14.68 g kg(-1), 9.55 g kg(-1), and 18.00 g kg(-1) in Shuyang, Rugao, and Shanghai, respectively. The topography (q = 0.60) and the sand content of the soil (q = 0.70) were the main drivers of the spatial variability in the SOC in Shuyang and Rugao, while the carbon inputs (q = 0.68) predominantly explained the spatial heterogeneity of the SOC in Shanghai.

Since restoration of subalpine and alpine ecosystems is difficult, prevention of shallow erosion is of vital importance for damage control. However, current knowledge on relationships between grassland ecology, management and shallow erosion resistance is very limited. In this study, we assessed relationships between the surface-mat stability of the topsoil (0-10 cm depth), vegetation cover, species diversity, growth patterns, indicator plant species for high and low tensile strength, soil texture, total nitrogen, and soil organic carbon.Vegetation composition significantly influenced the surface-mat stability of subalpine grasslands. Some key species were associated with higher reinforcement than other species. However, surface-mat stability neither depended on the vegetation type (grass or forb), nor on the root type, but rather on individual species characteristics such as roots and clonal structures as well as a certain plant and structural diversity. A balanced nutrient supply was associated with higher surface-mat stability, while soil texture had no effect. We hypothesized that stabilizing effects of plant-plant connections in tightly interwoven, dense root and clonal structure systems dominate over effects of root-soil connections. Thus, effects of soil texture may be negligible for the surface-mat stability.

To solve the above questions, Jiangjin district, Chongqing City, as an area in low Se red beds, was selected, and 156 topsoil samples were collected to explore the relationships between Se content in topsoil under various land use type and soil properties (pH, organic matter (OM), major elements content in topsoil) and topographic characteristics such as elevation (H), slope (SL), and topographic wetness index (TWI) and geological condition (stratum). Geostatistics, principal component analysis (PCA) and Geodetector were used to analyze the controlling factors of Se distribution in topsoil. The results show that in the analyzed topsoil (1) Se contents vary from 0.039 to 1.110 mg/kg, with a mean of 0.315 mg/kg, and higher than the background value of Chinese soil (0.290 mg/kg). 82.3% are classified as having moderate Se levels (Se > 0.175 mg/kg). (2) The Se contents in northeast of Jiangjin district are higher (Se > 0.315 mg/kg) than the midwest (Se < 0.315 mg/kg). (3) The key controlling factor of the soil Se distribution is OM. In addition, the soil weathering and leaching process and pedogenic rock are the secondary factors controlling Se distribution. Together, these findings reveal that Se-rich soil of low Se belt tends to be distributed in regions with higher OM, stronger leaching, and carbonate parent materials. These observations are beneficial to explore the Se-rich soil resources in low Se region in China.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Red Beds region;Geodetector;Selenium;Soil organic matter;Spatial variation;AGRICULTURAL SOILS;ORGANIC-MATTER;LAND-USE;COUNTY;WATER;BIOAVAILABILITY;DISTRICT;ELEMENTS;IMPACT;WHEAT", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Chongqing Normal Univ, Key Lab GIS Applicat Res, Chongqing 401331, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Chongqing Normal Univ, Geog & Tourism Coll, Chongqing 401331, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Shandong Inst Geol Sci, Jinan 250013, Peoples R China\n[ 4 ]‎ Minist Land & Resources, Key Lab Gold Mineralisat Proc & Resource Utilisat, Jinan 250013, Peoples R China\n[ 5 ]‎ Key Lab Metallogen Geol Proc & Resources Utilisat, Jinan 250013, Peoples R China\n[ 6 ]‎ Univ Nevada, Nevada Bur Mines & Geol, Reno, NV 89557 USA", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Geology; Agriculture; Water Resources", "wos_categories": "Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Soil Science; Water Resources"}

We quantified spatiotemporal variations in SOC in three typical regions (Shuyang, Rugao, and Shanghai) in southeastern China during 1981-2011, by using geographically weighted regression (GWR), and explored the drivers with a geographical detector method. A total of 219 topsoil samples were collected in the three regions to measure the SOC in 2011, and a total of 109 SOC data for 1981 were obtained from the soil survey reports of Shuyang, Rugao, and Shanghai, which involved in the database of the second national soil survey of China. The results showed that the mean SOC contents in 2011 were 14.68 g kg(-1), 9.55 g kg(-1), and 18.00 g kg(-1) in Shuyang, Rugao, and Shanghai, respectively. The topography (q = 0.60) and the sand content of the soil (q = 0.70) were the main drivers of the spatial variability in the SOC in Shuyang and Rugao, while the carbon inputs (q = 0.68) predominantly explained the spatial heterogeneity of the SOC in Shanghai. Significant increases in SOC storage occurred in Shuyang and Rugao from 1981 to 2011, with increase rates of 0.55 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and 0.26 t ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Land use change (dryland farming to rice cultivation) was identified as the largest driver of the SOC increases in Shuyang and Rugao (q values of 0.16 and 0.09, respectively), followed by increasing carbon inputs (0.14 and 0.07). However, the SOC storage in Shanghai rapidly decreased at a rate of -0.38 t ha(-1) yr(-1) during 1981-2011. The land use change from wetlands to rice cultivation was the primary reason for the decreasing SOC (q = 0.24), and a net decrease in carbon inputs between 1981 and 2011 was another main driver of the reduction in the SOC in Shanghai (q = 0.14).

Urban built-up areas in Northeast China from 1993 to 2013 are extracted and temporal and spatial patterns of urban development are studied. Combining the economic, population, industrial structure, ecological and other statistical data, a geographical detector is applied to study the main influencing factors of urban development in Northeast China. According to a selection of 10 typical cities, the annual urban expansion speed and the urbanization intensity index are calculated to quantitatively analyze the development of typical cities. The present study indicates that the urbanization process in Northeast China was slow during 1995-1996. In fact, except for Daqing, the other typical cities developed slowly before 2003. While the urbanization process accelerated after 2003, it reached to its maximum rate in 2010. Moreover, it is observed that from 1993 to 2013, centers of cities gradually moved to their regional centers. On the other hand, it is concluded that from 2004 to 2013, the regional gross domestic product (GDP), GDP of the secondary industry, gross industrial product, GDP of the tertiary industry and the total investment in fixed assets were main indicators of the urbanization that affected change in the urban built-up area in Northeast China.

However, the influence of complex topographic and climatic features makes it challenging to identify the exact location of the boundary, and different scholars delimit the boundary with significant differences. In addition, there is a gradual transition between climate zones, and no real dividing line exists. To explore the climate regionalization of the QDM, we focused on the identification of the transition zone rather than the exact location of the boundary between subtropical and temperate zones. Thus, we proposed a new workflow for climate regionalization based on the Geodetector-SVM model (a combination of Geodetector and support vector machines). First, we selected the spatial distribution data of six vegetation types (including typical subtropical and temperate vegetation) to represent the spatial distribution of climatic zones. Environmental factors (such as topography, temperature, precipitation, and soil) were used as explanatory variables for the spatial distribution of vegetation. Second, using the Geodetector-SVM model, the distribution characteristics and suitable environment of typical vegetation in different climatic zones are comprehensively explored.

Because of drought conditions and fragile ecology, these regions cannot develop agriculture at the expense of the environment. Given the challenges of global warming, the green total factor productivity (GTFP), taking CO(2)emissions as an undesirable output, is an effective index for measuring the sustainability of agricultural development. Agricultural GTFP can be influenced by both internal production factors (labor force, machinery, land, agricultural plastic film, diesel, pesticide, and fertilizer) and external climate factors (temperature, precipitation, and sunshine duration). In this study, we used the Super-slacks-based measure (Super-SBM) model to measure agricultural GTFP during the period 2000-2016 at the regional level. Our results show that the average agricultural GTFP of most provinces and autonomous regions in arid and semi-arid regions underwent a fluctuating increase during the study period (2000-2016), and the fluctuation was caused by the production factors (input and output factors). To improve agricultural GTFP, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Gansu should reduce agricultural labor force input; Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Shanxi should decrease machinery input; Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Shanxi should reduce fertilizer input; Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Gansu, and Ningxia should reduce diesel input; Xinjiang and Gansu should decrease plastic film input; and Gansu, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia should cut pesticide input. Desirable output agricultural earnings should be increased in Qinghai and Tibet, and undesirable output (CO(2)emissions) should be reduced in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu, and Shaanxi. Agricultural GTFP is influenced not only by internal production factors but also by external climate factors. To determine the influence of climate factors on GTFP in these provinces and autonomous regions, we used a Geographical Detector (Geodetector) model to analyze the influence of climate factors (temperature, precipitation, and sunshine duration) and identify the relationships between different climate factors and GTFP. We found that temperature played a significant role in the spatial heterogeneity of GTFP among provinces and autonomous regions in arid and semi-arid regions. For Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet, a suitable average annual temperature would be in the range of 7 degrees C-9 degrees C; for Gansu, Shanxi, and Ningxia, it would be 11 degrees C-13 degrees C; and for Shaanxi, it would be 15 degrees C-17 degrees C. Stable climatic conditions and more efficient production are prerequisites for the development of sustainable agriculture. Hence, in the agricultural production process, reducing the redundancy of input factors is the best way to reduce CO(2)emissions and to maintain temperatures, thereby improving the agricultural GTFP.The significance of this study is that it explores the impact of both internal production factors and external climatic factors on the development of sustainable agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions, identifying an effective way forward for the arid and semi-arid regions of Northwest China.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "climate change;agricultural GTFP;Super-slacks-based measure (Super-SBM) model;Geodetector;CO(2)emissions;arid regions;semi-arid regions;WATER-USE EFFICIENCY;RAINFALL HARVESTING SYSTEM;RIDGE-FURROW;CARBON EMISSIONS;PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH;ENERGY-CONSUMPTION;CROP PRODUCTIVITY;LOESS PLATEAU;GRAIN-YIELD;LAND-USE", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Ocean Univ China, Sch Econ, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Ocean Univ China, Inst Marine Dev, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Ocean Univ China, Sch Foreign Languages, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China\n[ 4 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China\n[ 5 ]‎ Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Environmental Sciences & Ecology", "wos_categories": "Environmental Sciences"}

As a crucial ecological barrier in upper reaches of the Yangtze River, this area is abundant in water resources and mineral resources, such as vanadium and titanium. However, due to its over-development for nonnatural urban economy in the mining industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry, ecological problems are getting worse. Such problems as soil erosion and groundwater pollution have led obvious ecological degeneration in Panzhihua city. Therefore, for protecting the eco-environment and planning construction, it is significant to scientifically recognize that how eco-environment changes based on spatial-temporal, and how the driving mechanism affects Panzhihua city. Nowadays, there are some theories and methods that study eco-environmental protection and city construction in Panzhihua, but they are not comprehensive enough to study its spatial-temporal evolution and driving-force system. This study takes Panzhihua City as the research area of which evaluation factors, for example, topography, soil, vegetation, and meteorological factors, are chosen to construct an evaluation system suitable for the ecological environment vulnerability of Panzhihua City. These factors are selected in three aspects, which are ecological sensitivity, ecological recovery, and ecological pressure from 2005 to 2015 in this area. Then, spatial principal component analysis method, CA-Markov model, and dynamic degree model are applied to analyze the spatial-temporal evolution for ecological vulnerability based on three periods from 2005 to 2015 in Panzhihua City. Besides, GeoDetector is used to quantitatively analyze how spatial-temporal disparities change and what drives them to change. The results show that (1) during these 10 years, the overall ecological fragility of Panzhihua City is steadily increasing from northwest to southeast.

Here, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the network model in mapping ESF by constructing a freshwater service flow network for the Yanhe watershed in China. We concluded that from 2000 to 2015 freshwater demand was approaching the limit of freshwater supply in the Yanhe watershed, with the freshwater demand continuously increasing. Due to the shortage of freshwater service, the deficit nodes and stop-flowing edges in the freshwater service flow network increased, and the network density decreased. These results can provide useful information to guide watershed freshwater resource management (e.g. optimizing the allocation of freshwater resources across the watershed and designing payment schemes for freshwater service) in the Yanhe watershed, particularly in a time of population growth, climate change, and threats of water scarcity.

Using the standard deviation ellipse and moving window method, the ecological status and space-time changes were explored for both their external and internal factors in the Hami Oasis. Finally, a geo-detector was employed to determine the driving factors of the ecological quality of the Hami Oasis. The results revealed that: (1) In the remote sensing ecological index constructed in the Hami Oasis, the main influencing factors were dryness and wetness. The average value of the ecological quality of the oasis was less than 0.5, and the ecological quality level was relatively poor. Among the five grades of ecological quality in the Hami Oasis, the poor grade and the good grade showed the largest changes, decreasing by 200 and increasing by 300, respectively, which were mainly concentrated in the periphery of the oasis.

Moreover, the ecological quality of the Hami Oasis presented a ringlike nesting distribution pattern from the internal built-up area to the artificial oasis periphery.

This study aims to detect those important driving factors and their potential interactions on soil erosion. Findings would facilitate the rational development of soil and water conservation. Materials and methods Here, soil erosion was simulated using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) in the Qiantang River catchment, southeast China, for the period of 2006-2015. Contributions to soil erosion by six driving factors including land cover type, annual rainfall, elevation, slope, soil type, and vegetation coverage were quantitatively analyzed via Qiantang River Catchment geographic detectors. Results and discussions The results suggest that vegetation coverage explains 7.28% of soil erosion distribution, and the impact of vegetation coverage on soil erosion is significantly larger than that of the other five driving factors (p < 0.05). In recent years, the explanatory power of vegetation coverage to soil erosion has experienced a change from increasing to decreasing trend. The interaction between vegetation coverage and slope explains up to 32.69% of soil erosion distribution, and an increasing trend has been detected in the explanatory power of this interaction. The spatial heterogeneity of soil erosion can be well understood by vegetation coverage and elevation. The high-risk areas are featured by elevation ranging from 1135 to 1777 m or vegetation coverage between 50 and 62%. Changes in vegetation coverage and its spatial distribution at different elevations are the main causes of the variations in the explanatory power. Conclusions The spatial analysis and quantitative analysis of six driving factors in soil erosion have improved the understanding of the heterogeneity in soil erosion. Measures in soil and water conservation should be strengthened in high-risk areas. The interaction between vegetation coverage and slope is the dominating contributor to soil erosion.

We also used land use data and demographic data at a 5-year interval from 1990 to 2015 to quantify PCAA and HAI in four different spatial scales across over the Loess Plateau region. These four scales include the whole loess Plateau region, provincial (autonomous region) scale, municipal (autonomous prefecture) scale, and county (city, district) scale. The theoretical model of arable land use pattern and the HAI calculation model were used comprehensively. We performed spatial analysis on the whole PCAA and HAI with the support of GIS geographic information technology, and conducted spatial autocorrelation analysis and Pearson's correlation analysis. We performed analysis of factor driving on the PCAA and HAI for different land-use types at the county (city, district) scale. We found that the changes in arable land use pattern of the Loess Plateau were dominated by human activities at the whole region and provincial scales from 1990 to 2015. However, at the municipal and county scales, human activities account for 60% of the changes in land use pattern. Two interesting findings were found at the municipal and county scales: one is that with the changing rate of HAI increases, the changing rate of PCAA decreased substantially; the second is that with HAI decreases, PCAA increased significantly. Besides, the changes in arable land use pattern can be explained by the synergy effect of multiple factors of human activities. This study provides insight knowledge in understanding the drives under the change of arable land use pattern in the Loess Plateau and hopefully can provide guidance for the sustainable goal of the local and country scale planning from the management perspective.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Arable land use pattern;Arable land area per capita;Human activity;The Loess Plateau;Multi-scale spatial analysis;VEGETATION CHANGES;CULTIVATED LAND;TRANSITION;FOREST;GRAIN", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Shaanxi Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Tourism, Xian 710119, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Xian Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management, Xian 710110, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Auburn Univ, Int Ctr Climate & Global Change Res, Sch Forestry & Wildlife Sci, Auburn, AL 36832 USA\n[ 4 ]‎ Northeastern Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Urban Affairs, Boston, MA 02115 USA", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology", "wos_categories": "Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences"}

In addition, geostatistical analysis was used to evaluate the impact of extreme weather events on cities livability. It was established that heatwaves and extreme precipitation events have significant impact on the livability of cities in southern China, whereas freezing weather drives the change of urban livability in northern areas. Combinations of different extreme weather conditions will have greater impact on urban livability.

Experiments covering 368 cities and 9 urban agglomerations were conducted in China in 2015 and more than 20 factors were considered. The modified GWR coefficients (MGCs) were calculated for six variables, including two emission factors (SO2 and NO2 concentrations), two meteorological factors (relative humidity and lifted index), and two topographical factors (woodland percentage and elevation). Then the spatial distribution of MGCs was analyzed at city, cluster, and region scales. Results showed that the relationships between PM2.5 and the different factors varied with location. SO2 emission positively affected PM2.5, and the impact was the strongest in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region.

Spatial pattern characteristics and identification of factors that influence water yield are the basis for decision making. However, there are limited studies on the driving mechanisms that affect the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem services. In this study, we used the Hengduan Mountain region in southwest China, with obvious spatial heterogeneity, as the research site. The water yield module in the InVEST software was used to simulate the spatial distribution of water yield. Also, quantitative attribution analysis was conducted for various geomorphological and climatic zones in the Hengduan Mountain region by using the geographical detector method. Influencing factors, such as climate, topography, soil, vegetation type, and land use type and pattern, were taken into consideration for this analysis. Four key findings were obtained. First, water yield spatial heterogeneity is influenced most by climate-related factors, where precipitation and evapotranspiration are the dominant factors. Second, the relative importance of each impact factor to the water yield heterogeneity differs significantly by geomorphological and climatic zones. In flat areas, the influence of evapotranspiration is higher than that of precipitation. As relief increases, the importance of precipitation increases and eventually, it becomes the most influential factor. Evapotranspiration is the most influential factor in a plateau climate zone, while in the mid-subtropical zone, precipitation is the main controlling factor. Third, land use type is also an important driving force in flat areas. Thus, more attention should be paid to urbanization and land use planning, which involves land use changes, to mitigate the impact on water yield spatial pattern. The fourth finding was that a risk detector showed that Primarosol and Anthropogenic soil areas, shrub areas, and areas with slope <5 degrees and 25 degrees-35 degrees should be recognized as water yield important zones, while the corresponding elevation values are different among different geomorphological and climatic zones.

Applying the geographical detector method, this paper also delved into the contributing factors that influenced the distribution based on the natural, social and economic data, such as the potential crop productivity, the average slope, the urbanization rate and the time cost to reach the nearest cities. The results indicate that the migration of the population from the rural areas into the cities, which was a result of rapid urbanization, did not change the original population distribution in rural China significantly. The rural population was still concentrated in the eastern plains, basins and deltas, and the North China Plain and Sichuan Basin still house the bulk of rural residents, but the population density of rural residents in the North China Plain and Sichuan Basin decreased from 1990 to 2010. The rural population in China tended to be distributed around the cities. Seventy-four percent of the rural population lived in an area within a 60-minute driving distance from the surrounding cities. The areas with dense rural population were basically consistent with the locations of the current major urban agglomerations in China.

The results are as follows: a. During the period of 2003-2018, the hotel industry in Beijing maintained a high growth rate and had three growth peaks in 2008, 2010 and 2014. Meanwhile, major historical events, such as the Olympic Games had a significant influence on the development of the hotel industry. b. Between 2003 and 2018, the hotel industry in Beijing gradually developed from the centripetal agglomeration to aggregation + diffusion, and also from the single center to the multi-center. Besides, various hotels presented two characteristics of city orientation and scenic orientation. c. The natural geographical environment had shaped the overall pattern and characteristics of the spatial distribution of the hotel industry in Beijing, and the socioeconomic factors such as commercial activities, public facilities, tourism services and traffic conditions significantly influenced the location selection of the hotel industry. Therefore, the urban center is the ideal area for the spatial layout of the hotel industry. d.

More specifically, overall late spring onsets occur in 1979-1996, in which areas located in Jiangxi, northern Xinjiang and middle Inner Mongolia experienced constant changing spring onsets. Overall increasingly earlier spring onsets occur in 1997-2012, in which areas located in Fujian, Hunan and eastern Heilongjiang experienced the most variable spring onsets. Stable early spring onsets over China occur after 2012. Results also showed 15 temporal patterns of spring phenology over the study period and their spatial delineation in China. More specifically, most areas in China have the same FBD category for 40 years while northern Guizhou, Hunan and southern Hubei have the same category in 1979-1997 and then fluctuate between different categories.

However, research on the quantitative identification of dominant environmental factors in different ecological red line areas remains relatively inadequate, which is unfavorable for the zone-based management of ecological functional areas. This paper presents a case study of Beijing's ERL areas. In order to objectively reflect the ecological characteristics of ERL areas in Beijing, which is mainly dominated by mountainous areas, the application of remote sensing data at a high resolution is important for the improvement of model calculation and spatial heterogeneity. Based on multi-source remote sensing data, meteorological and soil observations as well as soil erosion and water yield were calculated using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs (InVEST) model. Combining the influencing factors, including slope, precipitation, land use type, vegetation coverage, geomorphological type, and elevation, a quantitative attribution analysis was performed on soil erosion and water yield in Beijing's ERL areas using the geographical detector. The power of each influencing factor and their interaction factors in explaining the spatial distribution of soil erosion or water yield varied significantly among different ERL areas. Vegetation coverage was the dominant factor affecting soil erosion in Beijing's ERL areas, explaining greater than 30% of its spatial heterogeneity. Land use type could explain the spatial heterogeneity of water yield more than 60%. In addition, the combination of vegetation coverage and slope was found to significantly enhance the spatial distribution of soil erosion (>55% in various ERL areas). The superposition of land use type and slope explained greater than 70% of the spatial distribution for water yield in ERL areas. The geographical detector results indicated that the high soil erosion risk areas and high water yield areas varied significantly among different ERL areas.

This study analyzed spatial differences and environmental factors influencing poverty incidence and reduction using spatial statistical methods and GeoDetector tools. It focused on Lijiang in the Hengduan Mountains of western China as the case area. The results indicate a notable decline in poverty incidence in most Lijiang villages during 2014-2018 under China's poverty alleviation strategy. However, there are distinct spatial differences for both poverty incidence and reduction. The main environmental factors affecting poverty incidence and reduction are available water storage and geological hazard risks. Socioeconomic factors such as administrative unit and distance to city center also play a key role. The anti-poverty policies in various administrative units have the most significant influence. However, existing policy formulation mainly considers elevation factor in mountainous areas.

This industry is still developing, so it is important to understand what drives environmental changes, particularly in NPP, when shale gas pads are constructed in sensitive areas. Few previous studies have addressed this issue, so we quantified how the NPP changed, and what drove the changes, when a large shale gas area was developed at the end of 2012 in a mountainous karst area in Sichuan Province. We calculated the trend in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 2012 to 2017 and used the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model to calculate the changes in NPP at different distances from the pads using remote sensing images for July 2012 and July 2017 and field survey data from July 2017. We then identified the factors that drove the changes with Geodetector. The results showed that the NDVI increased across 64.2% of the shale gas development area from 2012 to 2017 because of climate change, and only showed a significant decrease across 0.3% of the area, mainly because of the shale gas development. The NPP decreased by 110.1 t because of the shale gas development in July 2017, or by about 0.35% of the total NPP. Of this, 93.8 t were associated with the pad construction areas, and 16.3 t were associated with the area around the pads. The changes in NPP around the shale gas pads were mainly confined to within 150 m during the construction phase and 90 m once the construction was completed. The NPP at different distances from the pads during the construction period was related to the distance from the pad, slope, and land use. Once completed, the NPP mainly varied with distance, land use, and the distance from the pad to rural settlements. The NPP was most strongly influenced by the distance from the pad and the area of the pad. We suggest that, when planning the construction of shale gas pads, the pads should be sited on gently sloping areas, the number of wells on each pad should be optimized, land use type changes outside the pad should be limited, and the land beyond the pads should be reclaimed in a timely manner to allow the NPP to recover.

It was found that the spatial distribution of impoverishment in Yilong county showed some certain agglomeration characteristics,and there were high-value hotspots and low-value cold spots in poverty incidence. The elevation,the distance to the center of the county,the total grain output,the proportion of minority population,the proportion of major illness insurance,and the proportion of dangerous housing renovation were the main six factors that restricted the differentiation of impoverished areas in Yilong county. When different factors interacted with each other in the poverty incidence,the effect was greater than that of a single factor.

(1) From 2000 to 2015, the ESV in Shaanxi province showed the characteristics of rising and then decreasing. In 2005, the ESV reached the peak in the study period, while that of 2015 saw the bottom. The supply and regulation services were the core functions of the ESV in the province. The service contents in the food production and maintenance of nutrient recycling are the two types of services. (2) The distribution of ESV over the years showed a pattern of \"low in the center, while high at the edge; high in the south, but low in the north\". The areas with high values were distributed in the Qinling Mountains and the Ziwuling Mountains, and those with low values were concentrated in the Guanzhong Plain. The spatial changes in the ESV are more obvious. The whole province is basically covered by negative values. The high- value areas are less concentrated and concentrated in Northern Shaanxi. The second- highest values areas are scattered in Guanzhong and Southern Shaanxi. (3) Economic factors have the greatest impact on the ESV, with the strongest interpretation, followed by social factors, and natural factors contribute the least to the interpretation of ecosystem services. (4) The spatial intensity of the effects of various dominant factors on the ESV is different. The land reclamation rate is characterized by a gradual decline from south to north. The per capita GDP gradually increases from south to north, and the population density increases from northeast to southwest. The land reclamation rate, per capita GDP, and population density are all negatively correlated with ecosystem services.

The urban-land-expansion intensity index, expansion difference index, and fractal dimension were used to study how the urban land in this area was developed, and the geographical detector was applied to explore the relative importance, expansion intensity, and interactions of physical and socioeconomic factors. The results revealed that the urban-land-expansion intensity of the Pearl-River-Delta urban agglomerations exhibit a downward trend, while cities exhibited a trend of developing more coordinately from 2000 to 2015. Physical factors determined the direction and scale of urban development, and the urban land expansion in the Pearl-River-Delta urban agglomeration is mainly distributed in plain areas that have an elevation below 120 m and a slope less than 5 degrees. Socioeconomic factors have a greater influence on the expansion of urban land, and their effects have changed over time. Population growth and economic development has played a significant role in the expansion of urban land before 2005. Subsequently, the factor of GDP and distance to the core cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen controlled the expansion to the greatest extent. The impacts of various factors tended to become balanced during 2010-2015. The majority of the factors enhanced each other via their interactions, and the distance to the rivers always exhibited a greater enhancement when there was interaction with other factors.

And we used the geographical detector to quantify the impact of driving factors. The results showed that the largest patch index was decreasing and positively correlated with the ecological risk index, while the fractal index distribution, Shannon's Diversity Index and Shannon's Evenness Index were negatively correlated with the landscape ecological risk index. The ecological risk index in the study area had a strong agglomeration effect in space. The high values were grassland and forest mainly distributed in the western part of the study area, and the low value was mainly distributed in the north of the lake and cultivated and construction land in the northern. On the whole, the landscape ecological risks in the study area were mainly low and low-medium risk areas, and the average value of ecological risk kept decreasing. Geographic detector analyzed showed that altitude and human disturbance explained much of the landscape ecological risk, and factor contributions were all above 35%. In the future, it is necessary to reduce the disturbance of unreasonable human activities to the regional ecosystem of Nansihu Lake basin, reduce the ecological risk of river basin, and realize the sustainable development of economy, society and ecology.", "abstract_ch": "研究区域的景观生态风险变化趋势及其驱动因素,可以更加科学地保护和开发流域生态系统。以南四湖流域19752018年9期土地利用数据为基础,借助ArcGIS 10.2和Fragstats 4.2等软件计算景观生态指数,并构建景观生态风险评估模型,通过空间自相关性分析,探究南四湖流域自改革开放40年来生态风险的时空变化,并用地理探测器定量研究驱动因子的贡献量。研究结果表明:流域最大斑块指数不断减小,景观破碎化加剧,且与景观生态风险指数呈正相关;而平均分维数、香浓多样性和香浓均匀度与生态风险指数呈负相关。在空间上,生态风险指数具有较强集聚性,东部草地和林地区域主要是高值区,湖区北部以及西部耕地和建设用地则主要是低值区;总体上,研究区大部分为低风险和较低风险区,且生态风险平均值不断降低;地理探测器分析表明,海拔和人为干扰度因子贡献量在35%以上,对生态风险有显著的解释力。据此,以后应减少人类行为对南四湖流域生态系统的干预,降低流域的景观生态风险,实现经济、社会和生态的可持续发展。", "keywords_en": "land use change; landscape pattern; landscape ecological risk; geographic detector; Nansihu Lake basin", "keywords_ch": "土地利用; 景观格局; 景观生态风险; 地理探测器; 南四湖流域", "address_en": "Zhang Wenjing,College of Geography and Tourism, Qufu Normal University, Rizhao, Shandong 276826, China.Sun Xiaoyin,College of Geography and Tourism, Qufu Normal University;;Shandong Universities Key Laboratory of Nansihu Lake Wetland Ecological and Environmental Protection;;Rizhao Key Laboratory of Land Space Planning and Ecological Construction, ;;Shandong Universities Key Laboratory of Nansihu Lake Wetland Ecological and Environmental Protection;;Rizhao Key Laboratory of Land Space Planning and Ecological Construction, Rizhao;;Rizhao;;Rizhao, Shandong;;Shandong;;Shandong 276826;;276826;;276826.Shan Ruifeng,College of Geography and Tourism, Qufu Normal University;;Shandong Universities Key Laboratory of Nansihu Lake Wetland Ecological and Environmental Protection, ;;Shandong Universities Key Laboratory of Nansihu Lake Wetland Ecological and Environmental Protection, Rizhao;;Rizhao, Shandong;;Shandong 276826;;276826.Liu Fei,College of Geography and Tourism, Qufu Normal University;;Shandong Universities Key Laboratory of Nansihu Lake Wetland Ecological and Environmental Protection, ;;Shandong Universities Key Laboratory of Nansihu Lake Wetland Ecological and Environmental Protection, Rizhao;;Rizhao, Shandong;;Shandong 276826;;276826.", "address_ch": "张文静,曲阜师范大学地理与旅游学院, 日照, 山东 276826, 中国.孙小银,曲阜师范大学地理与旅游学院;;南四湖湿地生态与环境保护山东省高校重点实验室;;日照市国土空间规划与生态建设重点实验室, ;;南四湖湿地生态与环境保护山东省高校重点实验室;;日照市国土空间规划与生态建设重点实验室, 日照;;日照;;日照, 山东;;山东;;山东 276826;;276826;;276826, 中国.单瑞峰,曲阜师范大学地理与旅游学院;;南四湖湿地生态与环境保护山东省高校重点实验室, ;;南四湖湿地生态与环境保护山东省高校重点实验室, 日照;;日照, 山东;;山东 276826;;276826, 中国.刘飞,曲阜师范大学地理与旅游学院;;南四湖湿地生态与环境保护山东省高校重点实验室, ;;南四湖湿地生态与环境保护山东省高校重点实验室, 日照;;日照, 山东;;山东 276826;;276826, 中国.", "research_areas": "Agriculture", "wos_categories": ""}

As a concentrated area of China's impoverished rural population, the study on the spatial and temporal patterns of poverty in hilly and mountainous areas and its driving mechanism is of great theoretical significance for the transformation and development of poor areas and rural revitalization. Based on the perspective of regional poverty, this study, taking Yudu County of Jiangxi Province as an example, used the standard deviational ellipse, spatial autocorrelation, kernel density estimation, and geographical detector model to describe the geographical pattern of rural poverty and its differentiation characteristics in the county, identify the leading factors of rural poverty, and reveal the driving mechanism of poverty in hilly and mountainous areas. The results demonstrated that the phenomenon of spatial agglomeration exists in the occurrence of rural poverty in hilly and mountainous areas, and the aggregation effect decreases with the proper implementation of poverty alleviation policies. The dominant influencing factors responsible for the spatial differentiation of rural poverty in Yudu County include slope of the terrain, traffic accessibility to town centers from administrative villages, road network density, and the number of public service agencies. As time goes, the influence of natural resource endowment conditions on the spatial differentiation of rural poverty has been weakened while geographic conditions gradually plays a leading role.

The results showed that in space, the ecological vulnerability of Zhangjiakou was characterized by a low to high pattern from the south to the north, which was consistent with the natural environmental characteristics of Bashang plateau (at a higher altitude) and the area below Bashang. The ecological vulnerability of Zhangjiakou decreased significantly from 2008 to 2016, and the proportion of light vulnerable area in 2008, 2012 and 2016 was 27.24%, 29.54% and 35.57%, respectively.

The structure and function of ecosystem was developing in a positive direction. And the spatial distribution differences of ecological vulnerability in Zhangjiakou area were mainly related to the changes of slope, drought index, vegetation coverage and temperature. Due to high altitude, drought and less rain, the ecological fragility of Bashang plateau was generally high. The whole area below Bashang is slightly fragile, the ecological systems may have strong resistance to external interference, and the ability of self- recovery is strong. The results of 91 interactions indicate that the interaction between any two factors had greater influence on the ecological vulnerability of Zhangjiakou than the effect of any single factor, indicating that the ecological vulnerability of the region was affected by many factors.

Tupu is a Chinese word in Pinyin. It could be understood as map series, graph-spectrum, including the meaning of map, chart, graph, spectrum, plan etc., but we could not find a proper term for it in terminology yet. According to Chen's related literature, this paper discusses the connotation of his thought of geo-information Tupu, and holds that Tupu is the methodology of expression and analysis adopted in many fields, while geo-science tupu is a map series of geo-phenomena and processes in the field of geo-science. Geo-information tupu emphasizes quantitative geo-information (geo-database) and geo-computation, supported by geographic information system, it is expected to use geo-graphic language to visualize and analyze geographical phenomena in space and time, and to simulate the law of relationships between man and environment, reconstructing its past, evaluating its present situation and even predicting its future. The idea of geo-information Tupu is closely related to academician Chen's scientific career. Under the guidance of many famous Chinese profesosors, he laid a solid geographical foundation in his youth. In the early stage of career, he participated in a large number of practice of integrated geography and map design. These experiences promoted him to combine the comprehensive thinking of geography with the graphic representation. The development of remote sensing and GIS expanded his vision on geo-technology. In his later years, he put his passion and led China's development in these fields. Geo-information Tupu was developed, which was a collection of rich theories, methods and technical achievements accumulated in the study of geographical science all his life. Geo-information Tupu is a scientific problem that academician Chen Shupeng left to the later generations. Therefore, the authors puts forward some further reserch directions according to the newest related study progress in order to inherit Chen's scientific question. The development of Holographic map is an important basis for the visualization of geo-information Tupu. It is helpful to discover new geographical phenomena and new geographical laws. The \"spectrum\" detection of land surface information by remote sensing should be supported by the thought of \"map\" analysis in geography.

In this country, Shaanxi Province is one of the top regions with the highest HFRS incidence in the past years. It is of great importance to explore the potential influences on the spatiotemporal variations of HFRS epidemics across this province, which would provide useful clues for local authorities making targeted interventions on this disease.The county-level HFRS incidence rates during 2005-2017, as well as some potential natural and socioeconomic variables, were collected and analyzed by using spatial auto-correlation and hot-spot analysis tools as well as a Geodetector tool to explore the spatiotemporal relationships between the incidence rates and the potential variables. The HFRS epidemics in Shaanxi Province were obviously higher than the national level and presented clear temporal fluctuation and spatial clustering at the county scale. More than 90% of the counties with relatively high HFRS incidence rates concentrated in the Guanzhong Plain where obvious spatial heterogeneity was also observed. Some variables including the percentage of plain area and construction land, and population density separately accounted for about 20% of spatial variations of the county-level epidemic across the whole province. By comparison, the spatial pattern of this epidemic in the Guanzhong Plain with no obvious socioeconomic differences was mainly affected by precipitation, normalized difference vegetation index, and land-use types. Thus, the Guanzhong Plain with both spatially clustering higher incidence rates and obviously differentiated natural and socioeconomic conditions was the crucial region of the HFRS prevalence across Shaanxi Province. We suggest that precipitation, vegetation conditions, and land-use types should be heavily considered by local authorities for making effective interventions on this disease across Shaanxi Province, especially in the Guanzhong Plain with relatively high land urbanization and population density.", "abstract_ch": "肾综合征出血热(HFRS)主要是由鼠类携带传播汉坦病毒而引起的一类自然疫源性传染病,严重危害着人类健康。陕西省是我国HFRS疫情最严重的省份之一,发病率居全国前列,研究其疫情时空分异和影响要素对指导当地疫情防控具有重要意义。本研究基于2005-2017年县区尺度HFRS发病率数据,采用空间自相关、热点分析等方法分析陕西省疫情时空分异特征,并利用地理探测器探究影响疫情的主要自然环境和社会经济要素。结果表明:2005-2017年陕西省HFRS发病率明显高于全国水平,同时呈现明显的时间波动和空间聚集,平原面积占比、建设用地面积占比、人口密度等因素可以解释约20%的HFRS疫情空间分异;关中平原聚集了陕西省90%以上的高发病县区,其疫情亦呈现明显的空间分异性,主要受降水量、 NDVI、土地利用类型等因素的影响。由此可知,高发病县区聚集、且自然环境和社会经济条件明显不同的关中平原是陕西省HFRS疫情流行的关键地区。因此,建议陕西省HFRS疫情防控应当重点关注降水量、植被状况以及土地利用类型,特别是在土地城镇化水平较高、人口密度较大的关中平原进行有效的防控干预。", "keywords_en": "Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS); spatio-temporal characteristics; influencing factors; Shaanxi Province; Geodetector; Guanzhong Plain; factor detector; interaction detector", "keywords_ch": "HFRS疫情; 时空分异; 影响要素; 地理探测器; 陕西省; 关中平原; 因子探测器; 交互探测器", "address_en": "Zhu Lingli,Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences;;College of Geographical Sciences, Fujian Normal University, State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System;;, ;;Fuzhou, Beijing;; 100101;;350007.Wu Sijia,Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences;;College of Geographical Sciences, Fujian Normal University, State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System;;, ;;Fuzhou, Beijing;; 100101;;350007.Ren Hongyan,Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Beijing 100101, China.Ding Feng,College of Geographical Sciences, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, Fujian 350007, China.Lu Liang,Department of Vector Biology and Control, National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, State Key Laboratory for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control, Beijing 102206, China.Cui Cheng,Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences;;College of Resources and Environment, University of Academy of Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System;;, ;;, Beijing;;Beijing 100101;;100190.", "address_ch": "朱伶俐,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所;;福建师范大学地理科学学院, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室;;, ;;福州, 北京;; 100101;;350007, 中国.吴思佳,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所;;福建师范大学地理科学学院, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室;;, ;;福州, 北京;; 100101;;350007, 中国.任红艳,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.丁凤,福建师范大学地理科学学院, 福州, 福建 350007, 中国.鲁亮,中国疾病预防控制中心传染病预防控制所, 媒介生物控制室传染病预防控制国家重点实验室, 北京 102206, 中国.崔成,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所;;中国科学院大学资源与环境学院, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室;;, ;;, 北京;;北京 100101;;100190, 中国.", "research_areas": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health", "wos_categories": ""}

The effective identification and classification of data has become the key to understand spatio-temporal patterns, evolutionary processes, and driving mechanisms of geographic phenomena. However, traditional clustering methods are facing some challenges, such as large amount, high-dimensionality and poor-quality of the data to be dealt with. Therefore, it is necessary to improve clustering methods. This paper first describes the transformation from one-way clustering to tri-clustering. One-way clustering methods perform the clustering analysis along with the samples or the attributes. They played an important role in previous studies, but ignored local features that are very similar. Co-clustering methods perform the submatrix partitioning scheme based on location similarity of elements within the data matrix. They avoid shortages of one-way clustering by realizing the clustering from both rows and columns, making similar elements into the same submatrix and dissimilar ones into different ones. However, they cannot satisfy multiple directions interpretations of geographical research since they do not support 3D panel data body. Then, we develop a new tri-clustering method, presents the workflow of using tri-clustering to spatio-temporal patterns' studies, and summarizes how to construct the 3D data matrix for clustering according to different aspects of 'space-time-scale-attribute' involved in the analysis. Finally, we show some practices of tricluster. The results show that: (1) Tri-clustering is an effective method to identify the spatiotemporal differentiation of geographic data in the era of big data by solving problems, i.e. data of high dimensionality and low quality. (2) Tri-clustering is universal in the algorithmic level when facing different geographic topics, but the differences rely on the 3D data matrices constructed according to different aspects of \"space-time-scale-attribute\" involved in the analysis. And, different data matrices are clustered to different results, which answer different topics. (3) Tri-clustering is able to interpret the spatio-temporal differentiation of geographic data in multiple directions, multiple scales, and multiple hierarchies, and thereby reveal the superposition effects of spatio-temporal scales of geographic features. Finally, we emphasize the significance of constructing 3D data matrices based on different geographic topics and expect that tri-clustering methods can enhance the ability to analyze geographic data with multiple spatial scales and attributes in the future.", "abstract_ch": "随着地理数据获取能力的不断提升,地理数据体量呈指数增长,数据种类、数据性质更加多元化。对数据的有效甄别和归类成为理解地理现象时空特征、演化过程和行为机制的关键。传统聚类方法面临数据体量大、维数高、质量差的挑战,加之对地理空间与时间关联分析的需求,对聚类方法改进和提升研究的要求越来越迫切。本文介绍了从单向到三向聚类构建思路的变革。单向聚类是仅在样本或属性方向上进行聚类,易忽视非常相似的局部特征、易犯 横看成岭侧成峰的错误。双向聚类是基于数据矩阵内元素值的相似性,形成一个子矩阵分割方案,使子矩阵内元素相似度尽可能高,子矩阵间元素相似度尽可能低,从而实现行列两方向的同时聚类,避免了单向聚类的不足。鉴于双向聚类难以满足地理研究超出双向的解译需求,本文提出并研发了一个全新的三向聚类方法,给出了运用该方法开展地理时空格局过程探测的流程,总结了如何根据研究涉及的空间-时间-尺度-属性构建三维数据体;最后,展示了三向聚类的地理实践案例。结果表明:①三向聚类是一种大数据时代探测地理数据时空分异规律的有效方法,可以解决数据维度高、质量低等问题;②面对不同的地理问题,三向聚类在算法层面上是通用的,不同之处仅在于:根据不同问题涉及的空间、时间、尺度、属性的不同,构建不同的数据体;不同数据体聚类得到的不同结果回答不同的地理问题;③三向聚类可以实现地理数据的时空分异规律多方向、多尺度、多层次的联合解译,揭示地理特征时空尺度叠加效应。最后,论文强调根据地理问题组织数据的重要性,期待未来能够提升三向聚类在多空间尺度、多属性方面的地理研究实践。", "keywords_en": "tri-clustering; space-time-scale-attribute; integrated interpretation; spatio-temporal local similarity; spatio-temporal differentiation", "keywords_ch": "三向聚类; 空间-时间-尺度-属性; 联合解译; 时空局部相似性; 时空分异", "address_en": "Cheng Changxiu,Beijing Normal University;;Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University;;National Tibetan Plateau Data Center, State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology;;;;, ;;;;, Beijing;;Beijing;;Beijing 100875;;100875;;100101.Song Changqing,Beijing Normal University;;Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University, State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology;;, ;;, Beijing;;Beijing 100875;;100875.Wu Xiaojing,Beijing Normal University;;Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University, State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology;;, ;;, Beijing;;Beijing 100875;;100875.Shen Shi,Beijing Normal University;;Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University, State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology;;, ;;, Beijing;;Beijing 100875;;100875.Gao Peichao,Beijing Normal University;;Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University, State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology;;, ;;, Beijing;;Beijing 100875;;100875.Ye Sijing,Beijing Normal University;;Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University, State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resource Ecology;;, ;;, Beijing;;Beijing 100875;;100875.", "address_ch": "程昌秀,北京师范大学;;北京师范大学地理科学学部;;国家青藏高原科学数据中心, 地表过程与资源生态国家重点实验室;;;;, ;;;;, 北京;;北京;;北京 100875;;100875;;100101, 中国.宋长青,北京师范大学;;北京师范大学地理科学学部, 地表过程与资源生态国家重点实验室;;, ;;, 北京;;北京 100875;;100875, 中国.吴晓静,北京师范大学;;北京师范大学地理科学学部, 地表过程与资源生态国家重点实验室;;, ;;, 北京;;北京 100875;;100875, 中国.沈石,北京师范大学;;北京师范大学地理科学学部, 地表过程与资源生态国家重点实验室;;, ;;, 北京;;北京 100875;;100875, 中国.高培超,北京师范大学;;北京师范大学地理科学学部, 地表过程与资源生态国家重点实验室;;, ;;, 北京;;北京 100875;;100875, 中国.叶思菁,北京师范大学;;北京师范大学地理科学学部, 地表过程与资源生态国家重点实验室;;, ;;, 北京;;北京 100875;;100875, 中国.", "research_areas": "Computer Science", "wos_categories": ""}

It is of great theoretical and practical significance to explore the spatial characteristics and influencing factors of regional rural settlements. Based on the remote sensing interpretation data, the spatial pattern and influencing factors of rural settlements in Xinjiang oasis areas were analyzed by using the methods of spatial analysis and geographical detector technique. To reveal the rural settlement spatial influencing mechanism, and explore the rural settlement space reconstruction and optimization approaches, we selected Altay area, north slope of Tianshan Mountains area, Turpan Basin area and Kashgar area as sample areas for further analysis. The results show that: the oasis rural settlements in Xinjiang are small both in density and in scale, and are mainly concentrated in the distribution mode, characterized by a spatial distribution pattern of \"dense plain, sparse mountain, no village desert\", which presents two major density core belts of oasis on the north and south slopes of Tianshan Mountains. Firstly, rural settlements are mainly distributed in middle-and high-altitude areas (500-3500 m), flat and gentle slope areas (<15 °) and warm areas (annual average temperature 0-10 ℃ ). Secondly, rural settlements are distributed near the center of towns, which are less affected by the radiation from the center of cities and counties. Finally, rural settlements obviously gather along the roads and rivers, with the feature that the closer they are to the roads and rivers, the larger the number and scale of rural settlements. The spatial distribution of rural settlements in Xinjiang is mainly influenced by factors such as the accessibility of roads to towns, the accessibility of roads to counties, slope, proximity to rivers, temperatures and elevations. In other words, under these extreme geographical and ecological environment conditions in arid areas, the natural environment and geographical conditions are still the main influencing factors, and the traffic factors play an important guiding role, while the influence of economic and social factors are not significant. There are obvious differences in natural conditions and social-economic development levels in the four sample areas, and so do the dominant factors of the distribution of rural settlements. The north slope of Tianshan Mountains area and Kashgar area are affected by road accessibility factors, while Altay area and Turpan Basin area by terrain and water source, respectively. Road accessibility factors have different influences on the spatial distribution of rural settlements in various areas.

Taking Changshou District at Chongqing as an example, this paper surveyed and analyzed migrating labors from poverty-stricken families in the villages using a comprehensive evaluation method.

Extreme poverty is the priority for poverty alleviation and the tough row to hoe. We select the major poverty influencing factors from natural and social factors to build an evaluation index system based on spatial poverty and related theories. First, we use Pearson correlation analysis to differentiate poverty impoverishing and alleviation factors. Then, we use GIS and back propagating neural networks to define a natural impoverishing index (NII) and social economic poverty alleviation index (SEPAI), respectively, at provincial, municipal, and county levels. We then calculate a poverty pressure index (PPI) at provincial, municipal, and county levels by combining NII and SEPAI, and explore poverty spatial characteristics. We used the flexible spatial scanning statistical method to identify the severely impoverished counties among the poverty- stricken counties with PPI>1.63, which had higher poverty rate and difficulty in poverty alleviation. Finally, we diagnose dominant factors that differentiate severely impoverished counties, and identify the dynamic mechanism of regional extreme poverty differentiation using the geodetector model. Besides, we construct a theoretical basis for anti- poverty in rural China. The results show that NII and PPI spatial distributions are highly consistent at provincial, municipal, and county levels, with a significant distribution pattern: high in eastern China and low in western China. In contrast, SEPAI has relatively low spatial consistency at provincial, municipal, and county levels. The PPI poverty distribution pattern tends toward large dispersion, small aggregation dividing across the Heihe-Bose Line. A total of 655 poverty- stricken counties were identified, mainly distributed in major ecologically functional and agricultural production areas in China. High risk areas identified by spatial scanning are mainly distributed in the northwest, southwest minority, and border areas. We also identified 208 severely impoverished counties, mostly located in inter-provincial fringe areas.

There exists a large difference in population distribution of the Tibetan Plateau. Based on the town-level census data in 2010, we compiled a spatial population database to calculate the population density of the Tibetan Plateau. We found that the population distribution on this plateau was characterized in four dimensions, namely longitude, latitude, polarization and altitude. In addition, similar to the \"Hu Line\" for Chinese population distribution, we introduce the \"Qilian-Gyirong Line\" (short for Qi-Ji Line), a spatial division line of population geography in the Tibetan Plateau. Our main results are summarized as follows. (1) There are significant regional differences in the spatial population distribution in the Tibetan Plateau. The population density in the southeast was higher than that in the northwest. Compared to longitude-oriented, latitude-oriented and altitude-oriented regional differences, the polarization-oriented regional difference of population distribution was more prominent. This finding indicates that fewer people live in areas close to the cold-arid core of the Tibetan Plateau. (2) The spatial population distribution is closely related to the natural and environmental factors, including altitude, soil, water resources, climate and vegetation. The interaction between the natural factors has an impact on enhancing the regional difference of population. (3) The \"Qiji Line\" reveals the spatial differences of population in the Tibetan Plateau. The areas on either side of the line are approximately similar, whereas the population shares in the southeast and northwest halves are 93% and 7%, respectively. (4) In general, the population differences on both sides of the \"Qiji Line\" were stable over time. During 1982-2010 the population share in the southeast half decreased counterbalanced by an increased share in the northeast half.

With the development of multi-centralized Chinese cities, the gravity model must be validated because several relevant external conditions have changed. The purpose of this study is to validate Huff's Gravity Model using an individual mobile trajectory of mobile communication user in 2015. We follow Huff's two-step validation method: variable validation and parameter correction. Our main conclusions are as follows. First, attractions of commercial and employment centres conform to the law of the gravity model in which the attraction is proportional to the scale of a centre and inversely proportional to the distance from a centre. Second, in the spatial scale of Shanghai central city with spatial units in a 200-m grid, the mean distance exponent for commercial centres is 2.5 and that for employment centres is 3.0. The distance decay for commuting is greater than that for shopping trips, which means commuting is more sensitive to distance. Third, the gravity model can be used to predict the influence areas of adjusted commercial and employment centres based on validated variables and corrected parameters. Our results indicate that the prediction accuracies can reach 78.5% and 71.9% for the commercial and employment centres, respectively. The prediction accuracy for employment centres is slightly lower. This is because the attraction of employment centres is influenced not only by distance but also by factors such as family and housing prices, which will affect the prediction results. Lastly, in this study, we verify the spatial stratified heterogeneity of distance decay and determine that the distance exponent is not a unique constant because it has different values in different areas. Factors such as accessibility, distance to each centre, distance to a subway station and population density will affect distance decay.", "abstract_ch": "长期以来由于规模变量、距离衰减系数取值缺乏依据,引力模型在城市研究中的应用容易受到质疑,加之中国城市的多中心化使得模型应用的外部条件发生改变,模型验证工作的必要性再次显现。本文使用2015年移动通信用户的个体移动轨迹数据,使用Huff当年的验证方法,通过变量检验、参数校正两个步骤,验证Huff的引力模型。研究发现:①城市内部商业中心和就业中心的吸引力与中心的规模呈正比,与距中心的距离呈反比,符合引力模型规律。②在上海中心城区空间尺度、200 m网格空间单元下,商业中心吸引力的距离衰减系数平均值为2.5,就业中心吸引力的距离衰减系数平均值为3.0,表明居民就业通勤对距离更加敏感,距离衰减比购物出行更加显著。③经变量检验、参数校正后的引力模型可用于对商业中心、就业中心优化调整后的势力范围进行预测,预测准确率可分别达到78.5%和71.9%。就业中心势力范围预测准确性略低,这是由于就业中心吸引力衰减除受距离影响外,还受家庭、房价等因素影响,会对预测结果产生扰动。最后,研究还证实了距离衰减系数存在空间分层异质性:距离衰减系数不是唯一值,受道路可达性、至就业(商业)中心距离、至地铁站距离、人口密度影响,不同地区的距离衰减系数存在较显著差异。", "keywords_en": "gravity model; multi-centre; model validation; distance decay; spatial stratified heterogeneity; individual mobile trajectory", "keywords_ch": "引力模型; 多中心; 模型验证; 距离衰减; 空间分层异质性; 个体移动轨迹", "address_en": "Ding Liang,College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, China.Niu Xinyi,College of Architecture and Urban Planning, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China.Song Xiaodong,College of Architecture and Urban Planning, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China.", "address_ch": "丁亮,浙江工业大学建筑工程学院, 杭州, 浙江 310014, 中国.钮心毅,同济大学建筑与城市规划学院, 上海 200092, 中国.宋小冬,同济大学建筑与城市规划学院, 上海 200092, 中国.", "research_areas": "Business & Economics", "wos_categories": ""}

In doing so we adopted a regime change perspective, and applied the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method, geodetector, and multiple linear regression. We obtained the following three findings.

Second, when rural transformation sees the traditional agricultural regime replaced by the new agricultural regime, and finally the non-agricultural regime, the overall performance of rural development follows an inverted U-type development trend in a 3D space coordinate system. Simultaneously, rural population development follows an upward convex development trend in a 2D space coordinate system. Meanwhile, rural economic development follows an upward concave development trend, and agricultural production development follows an inverted U-type development trend, both in 2D space coordinate systems.

It is necessary to explore the relationship between UVs and vector for effectively dealing with these problems. In this study, land-use types, including UVs, normal construction land (NCL), unused land (UL), vegetation, and water, were retrieved from the high-resolution remotely sensed imagery in the central area of Guangzhou in 2017. The vector density from May to October in 2017, including Aedes. albopictus (Ae. albopictus)'s Breteau index (BI), standard space index (SSI), and adult density index (ADI) were obtained from the vector surveillance system implemented by the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Furthermore, the spatial and temporal patterns of vector monitoring sites and vector density were analyzed on a fine scale, and then the Geodetector tool was further employed to explore the relationships between vector density and land-use types. The monitoring sites were mainly located in NCL (55.70%-56.44%) and UV (13.14%-13.92%). Among the total monitoring sites of BI (79), SSI (312), and ADI (326), the random sites accounted for about 88.61%, 97.12%, and 98.47%, respectively. The density of Ae. albopictus was temporally related to rainfall and temperature and was obviously differentiated among different land-use types. Meanwhile, the grids with higher density, which were mostly concentrated in the Pearl River fork zone that collects a large number of UVs, showed that the density of Ae. albopictus was spatially associated with the UVs. Next, the results of the Geodetector illustrated that UVs posed great impact on the density of Ae. albopictus across the central region of Guangzhou.

Spatial pattern characteristics and identification of factors that influence water yield are the basis for decision making. However, there are limited studies on the driving mechanisms that affect the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem services. In this study, we used the Hengduan Mountain region in Southwest China, with obvious spatial heterogeneity, as the research site. The water yield module in the InVEST software was used to simulate the spatial distribution of water yield. Also, quantitative attribution analysis was conducted for various geomorphologic and climatic zones in the Hengduan Mountain region by using the geographical detector method. Influencing factors, such as climate, topography, soil, vegetation type, and land use type and pattern, were taken into consideration for this analysis. Four key findings were obtained. First, water yield spatial heterogeneity are influenced most by climate-related factors, among which precipitation and evapotranspiration are the dominant factors. Second, the relative importance of each impact factor to the water yield heterogeneity differs significantly by geomorphologic and climatic zones. In flat areas, the influence of evapotranspiration is higher than that of precipitation. As relief increases, the importance of precipitation increases and eventually, it becomes the most important factor. Evapotranspiration is the most important factor in a plateau climatic zone, while in the mid-subtropical zone, precipitation is the main controlling factor. Third, land use type is also an important driving force in flat areas. Thus, more attention should be paid to urbanization and land use planning, which involves land use changes, to mitigate the impact on water yield spatial pattern. The fourth finding was that a risk detector showed that Primarosol and Anthropogenic soil areas, shrub areas, and areas with slopes <5° and 25°-35° should be recognized as water yield important zones, while the corresponding elevation values are different in different geomorphologic and climatic zones.

Consequently, this article proposed a novel method about SUHI intensity estimation for the multicenters (mcSUHII) of urban agglomeration in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GHMBay) using nighttime light (NTL) data (i.e., DMSP/OLS) obtained in October, 2010. The mcSUHII method considered the RLST of SUHII estimation based on multicenter structure, and was more flexible to adapt the impact of human activity intensity. The study showed that compared with other RLSTs, such as suburban and forest, mcSUHII mitigates the underestimation bias caused by ignoring the multicenter structure. Importantly, the change in SUHII for urban agglomerations is greater than for a single city. Moreover, it was illustrated that the variation of SUHII presented an obvious inverted U-shape along the gradient from the inland to the coastal cities. The highest SUHIIs in the delta cities at day and night are similar to 7.27 +/- 1.71 degrees C and similar to 4.46 +/- 1.42 degrees C, respectively. Additionally, NTL served as the dominator together with other factors that were capable of explaining more than 90% of the spatial variation in SUHII in GHMBay.

(3) Geographic detection analysis indicated that the primary influencing factor was NDVI in Beijing, followed by population density, and their interaction was significant. The dominant factor was wind speed in Tianjin. The effect of human factors such as population density and the GDP of the secondary industry were also important. The effect of interactions between wind speed and the above factors were also significant. The dominant factor was population density in Hebei Province,followed by GDP and the secondary industry's GDP,and the overall interaction was relatively weak. In the past, the correlation analysis of the influencing factors was based on linear relationship of the overall area,while the geographical detection not only has wireless assumptions,but also reveals the linear,nonlinear and spatial relationships of the driving factors. From this perspective,the geographical detection is more reliable in studying the influencing factors. This study applied geographical detection to analysis of the impacting factors of AOD in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region,which proved its feasibility in this field and this region. At the same time, the results also had important reference value for air pollution prevention,industrial and agricultural layout and urban construction in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.", "abstract_ch": "基于MODIS 3 km AOD遥感数据,利用空间自相关模型及地理探测器对2010-2016年京津冀地区AOD的时空变化特征及其影响因子进行探测。结果表明:(1) 2010-2016年京津冀地区年平均AOD值为0.83,其中天津市年均AOD值为研究区最高,河北省次之,北京市最低。研究区及各分区AOD的7 a变化趋势大体一致,呈现先下降后上升再小幅波动的状态。(2)空间自相关分析表明京津冀地区AOD空间分布呈现显著正相关。局部高高聚集区主要集中在北京市东南部、天津市南部及河北省的中南部,低低聚集区集中分布在西北部山区。研究区高低聚集区面积均呈减小趋势,不显著区呈扩大态势。(3)地理探测器结果表明不同区域的主导影响因子不同,北京市首要影响因子为NDVI,其次为人口密度,且二者交互作用明显。天津市主导因子为风速,人口密度、第二产业生产总值等人为因子的作用力也较大,风速与其交互作用较强。河北省主导因子为人口密度,GDP与第二产业生产总值等的作用力次之,整体交互作用偏弱。通过地理探测器解析京津冀地区AOD空间分异的影响机理,其结果对我国大气污染治理具有重要意义。", "keywords_en": "AOD; aerosol optical depth (AOD); spatial-temporal variations; geographical detection; influencing factors; Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region", "keywords_ch": "时空变化; 地理探测器; 影响因子; 京津冀地区", "address_en": "Jing Yue,College of Geography and Environment Science,Tianjin Normal University;;Xi 'an Institute for Innovative Earth Environmental Research, ;;, ;;Xi'an, Tianjin;;Shaanxi 300387;;710061.Sun Yanling,College of Geography and Environment Science,Tianjin Normal University, Tianjin 300387, China.Gao Shuang,College of Geography and Environment Science,Tianjin Normal University, Tianjin 300387, China.Chen Li,College of Geography and Environment Science,Tianjin Normal University, Tianjin 300387, China.Pan Long,College of Geography and Environment Science,Tianjin Normal University, Tianjin 300387, China.Ma Han,College of Geography and Environment Science,Tianjin Normal University, Tianjin 300387, China.", "address_ch": "景悦,天津师范大学地理与环境科学学院;;西安地球环境创新研究院, ;;, ;;西安, 天津;;陕西 300387;;710061, 中国.孙艳玲,天津师范大学地理与环境科学学院, 天津 300387, 中国.高爽,天津师范大学地理与环境科学学院, 天津 300387, 中国.陈莉,天津师范大学地理与环境科学学院, 天津 300387, 中国.潘隆,天津师范大学地理与环境科学学院, 天津 300387, 中国.马含,天津师范大学地理与环境科学学院, 天津 300387, 中国.", "research_areas": "Environmental Sciences & Ecology", "wos_categories": ""}

We analyzed the spatial distribution pattern, connection intensity and spatial autocorrelation of highway passenger flow in Chongqing during the working day, weekend and May Day and revealed the influencing factors by means of a geographic detector.

First, highway passenger flow in Chongqing districts exhibits spatial agglomeration that is clearly higher in western Chongqing than in eastern Chongqing and forms an obviously dual-core \"star\" structure, with the main urban area and Wanzhou serving as the core. Second, a factor detector notes that the nighttime light area index (0.9251, 0.9512, 0.9541) has the strongest explanatory power for the spatial differentiation of passenger traffic in Chongqing districts, which is the key factor.

The nighttime light area index shows the strongest explanatory power under the synergy of tourist attractions, which are 0.9850, 0.9903 and 0.9908. But the per capita GDP and highway mileage have the most obvious enhancement effect after interaction (0.9544, 0.9661, 0.9652).

Based on ozone observation data from 13 cities in the JJJUA from 2014 to 2017, the spatio-temporal trends in the evolution of ozone pollution and its associated influencing factors were analyzed using Moran's I Index, hot-spot analysis, and Geodetector using ArcGIS and SPSS software. Five key results were obtained. 1) There was an increase in the annual average ozone concentration, for the period 2014-2017. Comparing the 13 prefecture-level cities, ozone pollution in Chengde and Hengshui decreased, while it worsened in the remaining 11 cities. 2) Ozone pollution was worse in spring and summer than in autumn and winter; the peak ozone pollution season was from May to September; the average ozone concentration on workdays was higher than that on non-workdays, showing a counter-weekend effect. 3) Annual average concentrations were high in the central and southern parts of the study region but low in the north. 4) Prominent positive spatial correlations were observed in ozone concentration, with the best correlations shown in summer and autumn; concentrations were high in Baoding and Xingtai but low in Beijing and Chengde. 5) Concentrations of PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, and PM2.5, as well as average wind speed, sunshine duration, evaporation, precipitation, and temperature, all had significant effects on ozone pollution, and interactions between these influencing factors increased it.

Business, restaurant, and accommodation factors are the main factors influencing the population distributions of young and middle-aged people. The accommodation factor plays a major controlling role at night, and its explanatory power gradually decreases during the day, while the explanatory powers of the business and restaurant factors increase and become leading factors during the day.

The spatial characteristics and vegetation composition of urban greenspace have a great influence on its cooling capacity. Objectives We sought to distinguish the cooling effect by different spatial pattern factors of greenspace and by the interaction of these factors, which may be useful in understanding cooling effect and designing urban greenspace. Methods Both the greenspace derived from SPOT6 and LST retrieved from Landsat-8 images are employed to identify the dominant factors influencing LST and investigate the interaction between any two dominant factors in the Beijing metropolitan area. Results The results indicate that the dominant spatial factors affecting LST vary by greenspace type, i.e., for grass, the number of patches (NP) and patch density (PD) have a significant effect on LST while for coniferous forest, the landscape shape index (LSI) is the dominant spatial factor. And the NP and percentage of landscape are the dominant spatial factors for broad-leaved forest and mixed forest, respectively. The interaction of any two dominant factors is larger than their individual effects, and the interaction between the NP and LSI of greenspace is not as strong as the interaction between the NP and PD.

The effects of meteorological factors and socioeconomic factors on HFMD incidence in Guangxi, China were analyzed using GeoDetector Model. Results This study collected 45,522 cases from 87 counties in Guangxi during 2015, among which 43,711 cases were children aged 0-4 years. Temporally, there were two HFMD risk peaks in 2015. One peak was in September with 7890 cases. The other appeared in May with 4687 cases of HFMD. A high-risk cluster was located in the valley areas.

Previous studies have indicated that lung cancer incidence exhibits remarkable spatial heterogeneity, and lung cancer is related to outdoor air pollution. However, the non-linear spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence in China remains unclear.MethodsIn this study, the relationships between the lung cancer incidence of males and females from 207 counties in China in 2013 with annual concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O-3 were analysed. GeoDetector q statistic was used for examining the non-linear spatial association between outdoor air pollution and incidence of lung cancer.ResultsAn apparent spatial and population gender heterogeneity was found in the spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence. Among the six selected pollutants, SO2 has the greatest influence on lung cancer (q=0.154 in females) in north China. In the south, each selected pollutant has a significant impact on males or females, and the mean q value in the south is 0.181, which is bigger than that in the north (q=0.154). In addition, the pollutants have evident non-linear interaction effects on lung cancer. In north China, the interaction between SO2 and PM2.5 is the dominant interaction, with q values of 0.207 in males and 0.334 in females. In the south, the dominant interactive factors are between SO2 and O-3 in males and between SO2 and CO in females, with q values of 0.45, 0.232 respectively. Smoking is a substantial contributor to lung cancer among men, either in South or North China, with q value of 0.143 and 0.129 respectively, and the interaction between smoking and air pollutants increases this risk.ConclusionsThis study implies that the influence of SO2 and PM2.5 on lung cancer should be focused on in north China, and in the south, the impact of O-3 and CO as well as their interaction with SO2 need to be paid more attention.

However, identification of the causes responsible for vegetation changes remain challenging. Using Geographical Detector, a new spatial statistical approach, individual and interactive influences of natural factors on vegetation NDVI changes were quantified for the Sichuan province. The optimal characteristics of key natural factors that are beneficial to vegetation growth were determined. The vegetation cover in Sichuan for 2000 and 2015 is good overall; areas with upper-intermediate and high vegetation cover account for more than 88% of the total area. Regions with an NDVI higher than 0.4 are noticeably transformed; regions with upper intermediate vegetation cover (NDVI from 0.4 to 0.8) tend to decrease significantly, whereas regions with high vegetation cover (NDVI>0.8) tend to increase significantly. Spatiotemporal variation in vegetation cover is very significant. Regions with high vegetation cover are distributed in the northeast part of the Sichuan Basin and on the northwestern Sichuan Plateau, whereas regions with low vegetation cover are distributed in urban agglomerative regions in the central part of the Sichuan Basin. Soil types, elevation, and annual mean temperature can satisfactorily account for vegetation changes. Natural factors have an interactive influence on NDVI. The synergistic effect of natural factors is manifested as mutual enhancement and nonlinear enhancement, and the interaction of two natural factors strengthens the influence of each individual natural factor. Natural factors within a favourable value range or favourable landform factors serve to promote and intervene in vegetation changes, adapt to climatic changes, and buffer against the effects of vegetation changes.

We then employ a novel method, specifically, the geographical detector, from the perspective of spatial stratified heterogeneity to reveal the potential impacts and interaction impacts of the natural and socioeconomic factors on air pollution. The results are as follows. (1) The grey relational degree results reveal that all factors in the topographical and meteorological layer, pollution sources layer, economic development layer, and urbanization layer have high relational degrees, indicating that these factors are closely correlated with air pollution. (2) The factor detector analysis reveals that the PM2.5 factor has the biggest q value, indicating that it is the primary contributor to air pollution, followed by PM10 and elevation. (3) The interaction detector analysis reveals that the interaction of two factors plays a more important role in influencing air pollution than does each factor individually. Moreover, the interactions between pair factors of pollution sources are the strongest. (4) The risk detector analysis reveals that elevation and precipitation are negatively correlated with air pollution, whereas pollution and urbanization factors are positively correlated with air pollution.

Therefore, this article attempts to study on the spatial-temporal evolution and influencing factor on land use-related CO2 emissions at region-county level to promote county economy from CO2 source to CO2 sink. 9 regions and 38 counties in Chongqing of China were thus selected as study objects. Based on land use data, land use-related CO2 emissions were estimated using direct and indirect CO2 emission models for the period 1997-2015. On this basis, the space-time patterns were revealed from two scales of region and county. And the main factors influencing CO2 emissions according to land use were revealed based on Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) and geographic detector analysis (GDA), respectively. The results show that: 1) at regional scale, CO2 emissions of different regions all greatly improve in which southeastern ecological protection and development area showed the largest increase. Increases in per capita CO2 emissions in two-wing (suburban) areas are higher than those in downtown and surrounding-downtown areas. 2) at regional scale, the influences of various decomposed factors on the change of CO2 emissions fluctuate. The effect of population shows an insignificant influence on CO2 emissions. Economic development greatly influences CO2 emissions. Additionally, energy consumption shows a significant inhibitory effect on CO2 emissions while energy mix exhibits significant hysteresis. 3) at county scale, heavy CO2 emissions are concentrated in core urban areas; moderate and mild emissions occur mainly in the main urban expansion area, the region around the main urban areas, and in regional hub cities; low emissions are mainly concentrated in the Wuling mountainous area in southeast Chongqing and the Three Gorges Reservoir area in northeast Chongqing. 4) at county scale, the main influences on land use-related CO2 emissions are total energy consumption, per capita GDP, and urbanization rate.

Results Through geodetector model, results showed that the elevation maximum value of power of determinant (PD) (PD=0.308), ethnicity (PD=0.260), followed by summer mean temperature, topography, elevation standard deviation, slope, population density were noticed. The maximum value of PD of summer average relative humidity, summer average precipitation, and regional GDP were all less than 0.200. In the ecological detector model, value of PD appeared significantly different from multiple factors such as summer average precipitation, regional GDP, average altitude, elevation standard deviation, slope, terrain and ethnicity (P<0.05). In the interactive detector model, after the spatial interaction, factors as: value on PD of summer average relative humidity, population density and regional GDP were larger than the value on the sum of PD of two factors with nonlinear superposition enhancing trend. Results from the risk zone detection showed that areas of moderate average summer temperature, low average precipitation, moderate average summer relative humidity, high average altitude, large elevation standard deviation, high slope, mountain topography, Tibeto-Burmese of ethnicity, low population density, low regional GDP were all related to the high incidence rates of bacterial dysentery.

A complete process integrated from investigation, monitoring, and evaluation to the analysis of impact laws was developed. Result indicated that coal mining causes gradual increase of landscape patches, landscape fragmentation, gradual decline of landscape connectivity, complexity and irregularity of landscape shape, enhancement of landscape heterogeneity and complexity, gradual decline of landscape stability, gradual decrease of grassland landscape and annual increase of unhealthy grassland landscape. The LEH of grassland basically belongs to the state of slight deterioration. In the past 15 years, the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of LEH in the study area are similar.

The sources and possible factors controlling the distribution of trace elements in the mosses were identified through multivariate statistical analysis and Pb isotopic ratios. The results showed that the concentrations of trace elements in the mosses were higher than the levels in most European countries but comparable to those in Chinese cities. Mosses had the highest concentration levels of Cd and Sb and slightly lower levels of other trace elements. Spatially, moss contamination with the trace elements was significantly higher in the eastern, southern and southwestern China than in other regions. Mining-related activities, fuel combustion and other industrial emissions were identified as the main anthropogenic sources of As, Cd, Pb, Sb and Zn, whereas Cr, Cu and Ni were mainly from natural sources. The precipitation from monsoons clearly altered the distribution of anthropogenic elements in the mosses.

Do factors operate independently or are they interconnected? Which regions have high pollution risk and should be paid more attention? The study area was in Huanjiang County, with 273 km(2), and geographical detector proved to be a useful tool to solve these four problems. We found that mine activity and pH value were the primary influencing factors for total and water-soluble heavy metals. The interaction effects of mine activity and soil type, pH values, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for total heavy metals, as well as pH value and mine activity for water-soluble heavy metals, were greater than the sum effect of two factors. Zones with a high concentration of heavy metals were closer to the road and farther from the mine area, which had low NDVI, large slope, high terrain, and large pH values. Concentrations of total heavy metals were higher in calcareous soils and in dryland and forests. Zones with a higher concentration of water-soluble heavy metals were closer to the mine and river, which had lower DEM and pH values The uncertainty of geographical detector was also analyzed on the basis of their interpolation accuracy and the stratification number of influencing factors, and we found that the existing sample numbers and the stratification number of influencing factors met the needs of geographical detector calculation.

Both environmental changes and irrational use of the grassland can result in severe grassland degradation in some areas of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. However, the magnitude and patterns of the physical and anthropogenic factors in driving grassland variation over northern Tibet remain debatable, and the interactive influences among those factors are still unclear. In this study, we employed a geographical detector model to quantify the primary and interactive impacts of both the physical factors (precipitation, temperature, sunshine duration, soil type, elevation, slope, and aspect) and the anthropogenic factors (population density, road density, residential density, grazing density, per capita GDP, and land use type) on vegetation variation from 2000 to 2015 in northern Tibet. Our results show that the vegetation index in northern Tibet significantly decreased from 2000 to 2015. Overall, the stability of vegetation types was sorted as follows: the alpine scrub > the alpine steppe > the alpine meadow. The physical factors, rather than the anthropogenic factors, have been the primary driving factors for vegetation dynamics in northern Tibet. Specifically, meteorological factors best explained the alpine meadow and alpine steppe variation. Precipitation was the key factor that influenced the alpine meadow variation, whereas temperature was the key factor that contributed to the alpine steppe variation. The anthropogenic factors, such as population density, grazing density and per capita GDP, influenced the alpine scrub variation most. The influence of population density is highly similar to that of grazing density, which may provide convenient access to simplify the study of the anthropogenic activities in the Tibet plateau. The interactions between the driving factors had larger effects on vegetation than any single factor. In the alpine meadow, the interaction between precipitation and temperature can explain 44.6% of the vegetation variation. In the alpine scrub, the interaction between temperature and GDP was the highest, accounting for 27.5% of vegetation variation. For the alpine steppe, the interaction between soil type and population density can explain 29.4% of the vegetation variation. The highest value of vegetation degradation occurred in the range of 448-469 mm rainfall in the alpine meadow, 0.61-1.23 people/km(2) in the alpine scrub and -0.83-0.15 degrees C in the alpine steppe, respectively.

Many regression models based on land use types and urban fabrics have been built to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution of air pollutants, however, few of them examined the relationship between urban morphological characteristics and the distribution of air pollutants in a megacity. This study investigates such relationships for six types of air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O-3, and CO) and a composite AQI (Air Quality Index) based on hourly data at 35 monitoring stations in Beijing in 2016, with morphological characteristics (Morphological building index), meteorological factors (Land Surface Temperature, LST), land use (vegetation, road length, gas station and industry point data), and population distribution data. We also analyzed the results with spatiotemporal regression and SSH (Spatial Stratified Heterogeneity) models respectively. According to the spatiotemporal regression model, the morphological building index (MBI) shows a strong correlation with the dispersion of PM2.5 (R-2 = 0.81) and AQI (R-2 = 0.80) in the warm season and this finding was reinforced through the Leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) analysis. From the SSH analysis, the road length in a large proximal region impacts air pollutants the most, especially for O-3; and population density significantly affects PM 2.5, AQI, SO2, and NO2 in the cold season. From an integrated interpretation, distance to nearest industry impacts the spatial distribution of NO2 in cold season, while it impacts that of PM2.5 and AQI in both warm and cold seasons. The research finds that these two models supplement each other well and together help to give us a better understanding of how air quality is affected in the urban landscape.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Air pollutants;Morphological characteristics;Spatial and seasonal distribution;Spatiotemporal regression;Spatial stratefied heterogeneity;LAND-USE REGRESSION;PM2.5 CONCENTRATIONS;NO2 CONCENTRATIONS;NITROGEN-OXIDES;RIVER DELTA;LEVEL PM2.5;HONG-KONG;POLLUTION;QUALITY;STREET", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Univ Georgia, Dept Geog, Athens, GA 30602 USA\n[ 2 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, Res Ctr Ecoenvironm Sci, State Key Lab Urban Reg Ecol, Beijing, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Computer Science; Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geography; Operations Research & Management Science; Public Administration", "wos_categories": "Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Engineering, Environmental; Environmental Studies; Geography; Operations Research & Management Science; Regional & Urban Planning"}

However, the contributions of these efforts to environmental changes and spatiotemporal variations in some environmental diseases have been seldom explored and evaluated. Gastric cancer mortality (GCM) data in two periods (I: 2004-2006 and II: 2012-2015) was collected for the analysis of its spatiotemporal variations on the grid scale across S County in Central China. Some environmental and socioeconomic factors, including river, farmlands, topographic condition, population density, and gross domestic products (GDP) were obtained for the exploration of their changes and their relationships with GCM's spatiotemporal variations through a powerful tool (GeoDetector, GD). During 2004-2015, S County achieved environmental improvement and socioeconomic development, as well as a clear decline of the age-standardized mortality rate of gastric cancer from 35.66/10(5) to 23.44/10(5). Moreover, the GCM spatial patterns changed on the grid scale, which was spatially associated with the selected influencing factors. Due to the improvement of rivers' water quality, the distance from rivers posed relatively larger but reversed impacts on the gridded GCM. In addition, higher population density and higher economic level (GDP) acted as important protective factors, whereas the percentage of farmlands tended to have adverse effects on the gridded GCM in period II. It can be concluded that the decline of GCM in S County was spatiotemporally associated with increasingly strengthened environmental managements and socioeconomic developments over the past decade. Additionally, we suggest that more attentions should be paid to the potential pollution caused by excessive pesticides and fertilizers on the farmlands in S County.

However, studies on the multi-factor synthesis are still relatively lacked. In this study, the simulation of soil erosion and its quantitative attribution analysis have been conducted in different geomorphological types in a typical karst basin based on the RUSLE model and the geodetector method. The influencing factors, such as land use type, slope, rainfall, elevation, lithology and vegetation cover, have been taken into consideration. Results show that the strength of association between the six influencing factors and soil erosion was notably different in diverse geomorphological types. Land use type and slope were the dominant factors of soil erosion in the Sancha River Basin, especially for land use type whose power of determinant (q value) for soil erosion was much higher than other factors. The q value of slope declined with the increase of relief in mountainous areas, namely it was ranked as follows: middle elevation hill> small relief mountain> middle relief mountain. Multi-factors interactions were proven to significantly strengthen soil erosion, particularly for the combination of land use type with slope, which can explain 70% of soil erosion distribution. It can be found that soil erosion in the same land use type with different slopes (such as dry land with slopes of 5 degrees and above 25 degrees) or in the diverse land use types with the same slope (such as dry land and forest with a slope of 5 degrees), varied much.

Based on statistics of soil erosion difference between diverse stratifications of each influencing factor, results of risk detector suggest that the amount of stratification combinations with significant difference accounted for 55% at least in small relief mountain and middle relief mountainous areas.

The scientific analysis of spatial and temporal differences and influencing factors of cultivated land intensive use in the region is of great practical significance for promoting intensive potential exploitation and efficient utilization of cultivated land resources. Taking the Yangtze River Economic Belt as a case study, evaluation index system of cultivated land intensive use was constructed from the dimensions of input intensity, utilization intensity, output efficiency and sustainability. Projective pursuit model was used to quantitatively measure the level of cultivated land intensive use in the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 1978 to 2016. Based on the multiscale perspective of watershed, province and city, through the coefficient of variation, spatial autocorrelation index, the paper explored multiscale spatial-temporal differences of cultivated land intensive use in the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The influence mechanism of intensive utilization of cultivated land was revealed by using geographic detector model. The results showed that: since 1978, the level of cultivated land intensive use in the Yangtze River Economic Belt has improved at the watershed scale, but in the evolution process, the difference characteristics of east high west low have appeared; the intensive use of cultivated land in the Yangtze River Economic Belt at provincial and city scales presents spatial agglomeration characteristics, and the smaller the scale, the more significant the spatial agglomeration. During the period of the study, the types of spatial correlation between provinces and regions were mainly positive correlation, and there was a phenomenon of club convergence in cultivated land intensive use in the Yangtze River Economic Belt at city scale. The hot spots are mainly concentrated in Shanghai and Southern Jiangsu, and gradually evolved into Shaoxing-Hangzhou and Lancang; the cold point area was mainly concentrated in the Western Sichuan Plateau area. Natural factors, population growth, economic and social development, and institutional policies can effectively explain the spatial-temporal differences in the intensive use of cultivated land in the Yangtze River Economic Belt; demographic factors and economic and social factors have a significant impact on cultivated land intensive use, while policy factors have a strong driving effect. Finally, suggestions were put forward on how to promote cultivated land intensive use from the aspects of comprehensive land remediation, increasing the input of elements, optimizing and adjusting the structure of cultivated land, and promoting innovation in agricultural science and technology. In addition, it should be pointed out that there are still some deficiencies in this study: only the spatial and temporal patterns of cultivated land intensive use in six time sections since 1978 are analyzed on the time scale, it is also necessary to further reveal the temporal and spatial differentiation of intensive cultivated land use in the Yangtze River Economic Belt at a multitime scale. In terms of the impact mechanism, the factors of farmer households have not been discussed in this study, and the factors of farmer households have an important impact on regional cultivated land use efficiency.

In accordance with the law of village development and the trend of evolution, it's of great significance to carry forward rural revitalization by zoning and classification on the basis of scientific recognition of suitable development types for various villages. Considering planning constraints, in this study, a comprehensive development evaluation index system was established in four dimensions of economic conditions, traffic location, resources and ecological environment. Among the index system, indicators such as the proportion of construction land area during the planning period and the distance from the urban core area belonged to the type of planning constraints, which reflected the impact of planning and the urban core area on the future development of the countryside; the rest were the status quo description category ones, representing the status quo level of rural development. After calculating and analyzing the status of integrated rural development, rural development types and multi-functional characteristics were identified by use of tools and systems such as SOFM network model and GeoDetector. In the process above, the SOFM model was used to obtain scientific and objective classification results which ranged from 2 to 16 categories, and then, the GeoDetector was used to obtain the number of best rural areas. The results showed that Under the influence of economic development, traffic location and other factors, development of villages in Miyun District differentiate largely in space, and the development level of area on the south of reservoir was generally better than the area on the north of reservoir. Miyun Town, Mujiayu Town and Shilipu Town thrived best and their rural developments were at a high level while Gubeikou and Xinchengzi Town developed most slowly. Our results also showed that villages in Miyun District were divided into seven zones such as traffic and ecology dominant high-level zone and resource and ecology dominant medium-high level zone. Traffic and ecology dominant and economy & ecology dominant high-level zones were the primary types of rural development. These two zones were mainly located in Bulaotun, Dachengzi, Jugezhuang, Mujiayu, Xitiangezhuang, Fengjiayu and Xiwengzhuang. With high quality of ecological environment, advantageous traffic location and strong economic development, villages in traffic and ecology dominant high-level zone showed high-level comprehensive development. Villages in economy and ecology dominant medium-high level zone had a strong economic development and great ecological environment, so they also achieved high-level comprehensive development. In addition, the results showed functional characteristics of different types of zone were summarized from a multi-functional prospective and suggestions for rural revitalization were proposed in accordance with the idea of focusing on advantageous functions and properly improving disadvantageous functions in order to guide the establishment of differential rural revitalization strategy. Overall, the results of the classification of rural development types based on SOFM and GeoDetector generally accorded with the regional reality, and can reflect the development differences of different dimensions of seven zones, as well as the impact of planning constraints on rural development.

The study showed that the spatial and temporal variation characteristics of PCD and PCP at the diurnal,synoptic and monthly scales were relatively consistent,and the heterogeneity of precipitation in Guangxi could be better expressed than that at the monthly and seasonal scales. The diachronic change of PCD in precipitation in Guangxi shows an increasing trend in northeast China and a decreasing trend in southwest China,and the trend of its future period is the same as the diachronic evolution. The spatial distribution of PCD in Guangxi has significant spatial autocorrelation and stratification heterogeneity,which are mainly reflected in the mean value,coefficient of variation and frequency of PCD.

The results of this study were as follows: (1) In the national scale, the comprehensive role of land use patterns and climate conditions leaded to the nationwide soil alkaline-nitrogen space differentiation. The difference of soil alkeline-nitrogen content under different land use patterns was generally manifested as forest (147 mg·kg~(-1))>grassland (113 mg·kg~(-1))>cropland (103 mg·kg~(-1))>water (95 mg·kg~(-1))>construction> unused land (55 mg·kg~(-1)). On the basis of land use, temperature and precipitation further affected the environment and vegetation conditions on the surface, which made the distribution of soil alkeline-nitrogen more complex on a national scale. And (2) in different comprehensive physical regionalization, the potential dominant factors affecting the spatial distribution of soil alkeline-nitrogen existed consistent, but there were also significant differences. In humid monsoon region of eastern China, soil alkeline-nitrogen was mainly affected by temperature. However, in the western arid region, precipitation and slope had a relatively large influence on soil alkeline-nitrogen. Moreover, in the area with complicated topographic conditions, such as subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest, temperate forest steppe and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the variation of elevation had the most important effect on soil alkeline-nitrogen content.

Bike sharing plays an important role in improving the accessibility of public transportation and reducing the motorized pollution. At the same time, it also brings out urban issues, such as excessive amount of bike sharing,and mismatch between supply and demand of bike sharing. The main reason for these problems is the lack of accurate prediction and effective scheduling for bike sharing ride. Exploring the spatial and temporal characteristics of bike sharing ride and detecting the influencing factors can provide scientific decision-making basis for precise prediction and effective scheduling of bike sharing.

The results show that the vegetation activities in Central Asia have remained stable and volatile on the whole in the past 25 years. In detail, NDVI in the middle and low altitude areas of the Kazakh hills has increased significantly,while the NDVI in the southwestern part of Aral Sea has been significantly reduced because of the close diffusion of salt dust in the Aral Sea basin. In addition,because of the contradiction between water resources development and utilization among Central Asian countries, the trend of NDVI in the midstream of the Syr Darya and the downstream has been reversed. The non - irrigated farmland in northern Kazakhstan has a large decline in NDVI, and the results are not significant (P≥0.1) due to the phenomenon of recultivation. According to the results of geo - detector model, the water factor dominates the vegetation growth pattern in Central Asia, and the temperature is negatively correlated with the NDVI change. The difference in spatial and temporal variation of NDVI between different terrains,elevations,soil types and land use types is also significant.

From the perspective of spatial distribution patterns, spatial agglomeration was observed with local high-value areas and low-value areas. The spatial differentiation of heavy metals was affected by the combination of topography and planting methods. The influence of topography on the distribution of heavy metals was greater than that of planting.

In recent years, Liupanshui has adopted a series of ecological construction projects, therefore, it is very important to quantitatively analyze soil erosion and its influencing factors. Based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation(RUSLE)model and geographical detector method, we calculated the average soil erosion modulus of Liupanshui city during 1990-2015. We analyzed the changes of spatiotemporal patterns, and explored the quantitative analysis of the influencing factors of geographic detector, and spatial correlation analysis. Results show that:(1)The Average Soil Erosion Modulus(ASEM)of Liupanshui was 23.50 t·hm~(-2)·a~(-1), with an average soil erosion amount of 1578.42*10~4 t·a~(-1). The micro and moderate erosion were the dominant erosion types, occupying 83.49% of the total area, while the strong and violent erosion accounted for only 5.3%. The strong erosion area in Liupanshui was mainly located at the junction of Beipanjiang River Basin and Nanpanjiang River Basin as well as the Karst areas with fragile eco-environment.(2)The ASEM was the largest in 2000, which increased by 5.50% compared with that in 1990. The ASEM in 2005 decreased by 18.2% compared with that in 2000. The ASEM in 2010 was the smallest, 11.4% lower than that in 2005. The ASEM in 2015 increased compared with that in 2010. The soil erosion intensity in Liupanshui city in 2000-2015 was weaker than that in 1990-2000. The area of violent erosion decreased, and the strong erosion shifted to micro, light and moderate erosion.(3)The vegetation coverage factor and the perennial average rainfall factor are important factors affecting the spatial distribution of regional soil erosion. Moreover, unused land, vegetation coverage less than 0.3, slope above 25° and rainfall between 1543~1593 mm are high-risk erosion areas.(4)Vegetation coverage and soil erosion have negative correlation in space, while rainfall factors have negative correlation and positive correlation in space.(5)Soil erosion improvement areas are mostly distributed in ecological engineering areas, so ecological engineering construction can improve soil erosion. Different ecological engineering protection priorities lead to different degree of soil erosion improvement. By simulating rainfall to calculate the soil erosion modulus and soil erosion amount before and after Grain-for-Green, it could be seen that the soil erosion situation in Liupanshui had improved after Grain-for-Green. Compared with cultivated land-forest land and cultivated land-grassland land use change area, Liupanshui city is more suitable to return cultivated land to forest.

Main conclusion is as follows. The construction CO_2 footprint was the trend of the overall fluctuating growth; building materials preparation and construction operations were the two major stages of the construction CO_2 footprint, while the CO_2 footprint of construction and construction demolition stage was relatively small; the CO_2 footprint of building materials preparation stage mainly came from steel and cement, and the CO_2 footprint of public buildings was on the rise.

Then we concentrated on the relationships between water conservation-soil erosion and net primary production (NPP) -soil erosion. In the different environmental factor gradients and geomorphological types, the spatial trade-off of ecosystem services and its differentiation characteristics were studied. The gradient analysis of the environmental factors shows that the spatial trade-off between water conservation and soil erosion decreases with the increase of vegetation coverage while the spatial trade-off between NPP and soil erosion increases with elevation and slope.

Based on township administrative units in the study area, and the study area was meshed into 2019 quadrates by a range of 3 km by 3 km, and the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of the ecosystem service value (ESV) in the Chaohu Basin were analyzed by using spatial statistics and buffer zone tools. Finally, based on the geographical detector tool, the interaction mechanism of natural, humanistic and socio-economic factors of the temporal-spatial changes of the ESV in the Chaohu Basin was analyzed, and the strategies for the spatial optimization of ESV were proposed in the paper. The major results were shown as follows. Firstly, the ESV of the Chaohu Basin decreased from 30.317 billion yuan in 1995 to 30.095 billion yuan in 2005 and 28.770 billion yuan in 2017, respectively. During the last 20 years, the ESV decreased by 5.11%, with an average annual decline rate of 0.23%. Secondly, the analysis of spatial transfer of ESV in the Chaohu Basin showed that the region of low level ESV was expanding and the regions of medium and high level were shrinking. The buffer zone analysis with the Chaohu Lake as the core showed that when it is far from the Chaohu Lake, the decline trend of ESV decreases, and the ESV in the core buffer zone during the past almost 20 years decreased by 18.55%. The change of ecosystem function in the core area of water environment protection zone of the Chaohu Basin deserves attention. Thirdly, the analysis of geographical detection showed that the human active index(HAI) was the leading factor of spatial differentiation of ESV; the terrain and meteorological factors were the important factors; the interaction of human impact factors, natural factors and social and economic factors jointly affected the spatial differentiation characteristics of ESV in the Chaohu Basin.

The population and spatial distribution of the population in the region are quite different, and the difference was the result of the combined effects of various factors. The natural environment is the most fundamental influencing factor for survival. The influence of natural factors on the spatial distribution of the population in the karst mountainous areas of the northwestern Guangxi cannot be ignored. This article selected the smallest administrative unit of the sixth national census-township (town) as a basic unit, and used the Lorenz curve and spatial correlation analysis method to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of population in the township (town) scale of the karst mountainous area in the northwestern Guangxi. The detector method detected the intensity of the influence of the natural factors alone and the natural factors on the spatial distribution of the population in the study area. The results showed that: 1) At the township (town) level, the spatial distribution of population was higher in the southeast section and lower in the northwest part, and the spatial distribution of population in the study area was extremely uneven. In addition, the population distribution also presented a significant positive correlation in space, showing high-value spatial units and high-value spatial units, and low-value spatial units and low-value spatial units present adjacent spatial aggregation states; 2) The influence of spatial distribution of natural factors on population distribution is obviously different. There is no karst town in the northwest and south-central part of the study area. Population density increases with the increase of human living factors, but only 79 persons/km on average. In the villages and towns with karst distribution in the eastern and southern Guangxi, the spatial distribution of population density and natural factors is not simply increasing or decreasing, but fluctuates with the change of karst distribution area; 3) The results of factor detection in geo-detectors suggested that altitude has the greatest impact (0.17) on the spatial distribution of population. The results of interactive detection in the geo-detector showed that after superimposed and interacted any two natural factors, the intensity of the effect exhibited nonlinear enhancement and two-factor enhancement. Among them, the catalytic capacity of the karst mountain was the most significant factor. After the karst mountain area overlaps with other natural factors, the population and its distribution enhanced the intensity of the impact, and the average increase rate exceeded 80%. This indicated that the main factors affecting population distribution are different from the other non-karst areas in the karst mountain area of the northwestern Guangxi, but they also have certain similarities. For example, altitude is one of the most important factors affecting the spatial distribution of population in both karst and non-karst areas. However, the density of river network and unique geological features in karst mountains have a strong catalytic effect on the spatial distribution of the population.

The response characteristics of scale and the spatial differentiation mechanism of the ecological service value are worth discussing. Taking the Dabie Mountain area located in central China as the research object, based on the data of land use classification, this paper applied the methods of spatial statistics, hot spot analysis and geographical detector to examine the dynamic evolution characteristics, scale effect and spatial differentiation mechanism of the ecological service value of Dabie Mountain area from 1970 to 2015. The results show that over the 50 years, the overall value of ecological services in the Dabie Mountain area increased by 951 million yuan, while in recent years it decreased by 395 million yuan, accounting for 41.54% of the total value added. Scale is helpful for understanding the pattern and process of ecosystem. To strengthen the study of scale characteristics in the evaluation of ecosystem service function can improve the objectivity, credibility and practicability of the evaluation results. Therefore, in this paper, we made a comparative analysis through the scale of four types, which includes 9- level amplitude. The results show that the unit scale of township is the characteristic scale of the spatial differentiation of ecological service value in Dabie Mountain area, and the spatial difference information of the ecological service value at the township unit scale is rich, and the type of township unit scale is a more appropriate research scale level in the study area. To strengthen the geographical exploration of the spatial differentiation of ecosystem service value will be helpful to carry out regional ecological planning and ecosystem regulation. In this study, we analyzed the spatial differentiation mechanism of ecosystem service value in Dabie Mountain area by using the geographical detector. The results show that the explanatory power q value of the ecological land use proportion, land use degree and human influence composite index among the 16 influencing factors contributing to the spatial differentiation of ecological service value is nearly 40%, which is the main reason for the spatial differentiation. Elevation and slope factor q value is nearly 30%, which is a secondary factor. There are mainly three categories and 30 types of interaction combinations with an interactive detection q value of more than 50%.

This paper builds the evaluation index system of the coupled development of human settlements system based on the five subsystems ofhuman-livingsupport- nature-society. The coupling model between two systems is extended to five subsystems of human settlements. The entropy method and GIS spatial analysis methods are used to analyze the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of coupling coordination degree of human settlements system in Liaoning Province from 2005 to 2016. The research shows that: 1) From 2005 to 2016, the coupling degree and coupling coordination degree of the human settlements system in Liaoning Province showed a slow upward trend. There is a difference in the degree of coordination between cities. The high value areas of coupling coordination degree includes Shenyang and Dalian. The median area of coupling coordination degree includes Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Dandong, Jinzhou, Yingkou, Liaoyang, Panjin, Tieling, Chaoyang and Huludao.

It is of great significance to understand and optimize mulched drip irrigation in arid region by analyzing the characteristics of evapotranspiration in mulched drip-irrigated farmland and comparing it with ordinarily irrigated farmland. Using the oasis sunflower farmland in the Sangong River basin on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountain in Xinjiang as the study area, the farmland evapotranspiration characteristics during the sunflower growth period in 2016 were analyzed using the Bowen ratio- energy balance method, geographical detector, and path analysis method. Furthermore, these characteristics were compared to those of ordinarily irrigated farmlands. The results showed that: 1) for mulched drip-irrigated farmland, the average daily evapotranspiration was highest at the flowering stage, followed by the maturity stage, and lowest in the seedling stage. With the growth of crops, the correlation between net radiative flux and daily evapotranspiration gradually decreased. The change trends of average daily evapotranspiration were the same as those of ordinarily irrigated farmland, whereas the average daily evapotranspiration of mulched drip-irrigated farmland was lower than that of ordinarily irrigated farmland at each stage. 2) Regarding the intraday flux in mulched drip-irrigated farmland, the net radiative flux peak was highest at the flowering stage, followed by that at the mature stage, and the minimum appeared at the seedling stage. In terms of turbulent flux, the latent heat flux was equivalent to the sensible heat flux at the seedling stage. Post the flowering period, the latent heat flux was significantly higher than the sensible heat flux, and this characteristic was the opposite at the mature stage. For the ordinarily irrigated farmland, the latent heat flux was higher than the sensible heat flux in all three crop growth stages. 3) The relationship between evapotranspiration and meteorological factors calculated by path analysis showed that temperature, humidity, and wind speed were the dominant factors influencing evapotranspiration. The lower limit of humidity determined the minimum evapotranspiration. The upper limit of wind speed and temperature determined the maximum evapotranspiration. The influence of wind direction was not significant on evapotranspiration.

Second,self-correlation showed that the expansion of construction land in Jiangsu Province had an obvious agglomeration distribution pattern. Jiangsu Province had formed an urban sprawl distribution pattern along the Yangtze River,and it also exhibited urban agglomeration. The coordination and stability of the expansion of construction land in Jiangsu Province all showed that the geographical spatial pattern of Sunan was greater than Subei. The main time driving factors for the expansion of construction land were the industrial structure,population growth and the living standard of residents. The proportion of second and third industry is the core time driving factor of the expansion. GDP and population density were the leading spatial driving factors for the expansion of urban construction land in Jiangsu Province.", "abstract_ch": "采用Landsat TM/ETM遥感解译数据,综合运用定性与定量方法,分析江苏省1985 ~ 2015年建设用地扩张的时空演变特征、类型与模式,通过多元回归和地理探测器方法探索江苏省和各地级市建设用地扩张的时空驱动因子及驱动机制。结果表明:( 1)江苏省建设用地扩张幅度空间上呈现苏南>苏中>苏北的特征,建设用地扩张速率时间上呈现先上升后下降的趋势,2005 ~ 2010年是快速扩张期.( 2)江苏省建设用地扩张呈空间自相关和明显的集聚分布。扩张密度分布呈现以江苏沿江地区为高值中心,沿海及苏北地区为低值连片区的空间分异现象。高-高值区主要分布在城市中心区.( 3)江苏省已形成沿长江的城市发展轴带和空间集约的都市连绵区,呈现外延型的空间扩张模式。江苏省建设用地扩张的协调性和稳定性,均出现苏南>苏北的地理空间格局,可分为4种类型:协调稳定型、不协调稳定型、协调波动型、不协调波动型.( 4)建设用地扩张主导时间驱动因子是产业结构转型、人口增长、居民生活水平提高和投资增长,第二、三产业比重是扩张的核心时间驱动因素,工业化是驱动建设用地扩张的重要动力.GDP和人口密度是建设用地扩张的主导空间驱动因子。", "keywords_en": "construction land; urban sprawl; driving factor; geographical detector; Jiangsu Province", "keywords_ch": "建设用地; 扩张模式; 驱动因素; 地理探测器; 江苏省", "address_en": "Wang Yazhu,Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology,CAS;;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences;;Key Laboratory of Watershed Geographic Sciences,CAS, ;;;;Key Laboratory of Watershed Geographic Sciences,CAS, Nanjing;;;;Nanjing, ;;Beijing;; 210008;;100049;;210008.Duan Xuejun,Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology,CAS;;Key Laboratory of Watershed Geographic Sciences,CAS, ;;Key Laboratory of Watershed Geographic Sciences,CAS, Nanjing;;Nanjing, ;; 210008;;210008.Wang Lei,Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology,CAS;;Key Laboratory of Watershed Geographic Sciences,CAS, ;;Key Laboratory of Watershed Geographic Sciences,CAS, Nanjing;;Nanjing, ;; 210008;;210008.Zou Hui,Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology,CAS;;Key Laboratory of Watershed Geographic Sciences,CAS, ;;Key Laboratory of Watershed Geographic Sciences,CAS, Nanjing;;Nanjing, ;; 210008;;210008.Yang Qingke,School of Public Administration,Nanjing University of Finance & Economics, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210046, China.", "address_ch": "王雅竹,中国科学院南京地理与湖泊研究所;;中国科学院大学;;中国科学院流域地理学重点实验室, ;;;;中国科学院流域地理学重点实验室, 南京;;;;南京, 江苏;;北京;;江苏 210008;;100049;;210008, 中国.段学军,中国科学院南京地理与湖泊研究所;;中国科学院流域地理学重点实验室, ;;中国科学院流域地理学重点实验室, 南京;;南京, 江苏;;江苏 210008;;210008, 中国.王磊,中国科学院南京地理与湖泊研究所;;中国科学院流域地理学重点实验室, ;;中国科学院流域地理学重点实验室, 南京;;南京, 江苏;;江苏 210008;;210008, 中国.邹辉,中国科学院南京地理与湖泊研究所;;中国科学院流域地理学重点实验室, ;;中国科学院流域地理学重点实验室, 南京;;南京, 江苏;;江苏 210008;;210008, 中国.杨清可,南京财经大学公共管理学院, 南京, 江苏 210046, 中国.", "research_areas": "Geography", "wos_categories": ""}

Nevertheless, the development strategy of urban bias, the low level of inter-generational culture of farmers, and the constraints of environmental bottlenecks have led to the emergence of the binary urban-rural structure. With a large base and a wide distribution of vulnerable rural population, the development of the poor and the multi-dimensional poverty group, the problem of the vicious cycle of poverty is extremely serious. China has been an active advocator and a powerful promoter of the world's poverty alleviation cause. The problem of rural poverty remains a significance hurdle to building a moderately prosperous society comprehensively and charting the roadmap for rural vitalization in China. Using entropy method and geodetector, the paper selects 18 indicators from 3 aspects of farmers' basic survival performance, self-development performance and county poverty alleviation performance to study the anti-poverty performance evaluation, spatial geographical differentiation characteristics and influencing factors of 51 poverty-stricken counties in Hunan Province, China in 2017. It can be shown that: farmers in poverty-stricken counties in Hunan Province can generally meet the basic needs of survival; the poverty-stricken counties around the urban areas such as Wulingyuan district and Hecheng district, as well as those around the Luoxiao Mountain Range, have higher scores for self-development performance, while those around the Xuefeng Mountain Range are generally lower; the poverty-stricken counties with high levels of poverty alleviation performance are scattered in space, and the performance levels of the northwestern minority areas in the province and the poverty-stricken counties in the south-central areas need to be strengthened. The anti-poverty performance of Hunan Province generally presents spatial characteristics of alternating high, medium and low performance levels. The poverty-stricken counties with higher anti-poverty performance levels are closer to urban areas such as Wulingyuan district and Hecheng district and Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomerations.

In terms of generating high-resolution surfaces of meteorological parameters, the estimation accuracy of existing models is limited for air temperature, and is poor for relative humidity and wind speed (few studies reported). With the measurement data of 824 monitoring stations covering the mainland of China in 2015, this study compared the typical Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and autoencoder-based residual neural network (here after, residual network for short) in terms of predicting three meteorological parameters, i.e. air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. The performances of the two models were evaluated through 10-fold cross-validation. Basic variables including latitude, longitude, elevation, and the day of the year are used in the air temperature models. In addition to the basic variables, the relative humidity models use air temperature and ozone concentration as covariates, and the wind speed models use wind speed coarse-resolution reanalysis data as covariates. In our spatiotemporal models, spatial coordinates capture the spatial variation and time index of the day captures the time variation. Compared with GAM, residual network significantly improved the prediction accuracy: on average, CV (Cross Validation) R2of the three meteorological factors increased by 0.21, CV RMSE decreased by 37%, and the relative humidity model improved the most (CV R2: 0.85 vs. 0.52, CV RMSE: 7.53% vs. 13.59%).

Hierarchical diagnosis and treatment (HDT) reform is of great significance for optimising the distribution of healthcare resources and promoting fairness across health services. In this study, exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) was applied to evaluate spatial patterns at the lower and upper levels of healthcare resources. The Geodetector model was used to analyse the influences of the healthcare system at the municipal and county levels during 2015. The results show that there is significant spatial clustering in the distribution of the two-level healthcare resources. Influences on upper-level healthcare resources are more significant than those on lower levels. The dominant influencing factors of the two-level healthcare resources differ across spatial scales and regions. In terms of upperlevel healthcare resources, urbanisation, population density and the level of economic development are the dominant global factors, in addition to the regional factors of population aging, topography and the morbidity of epidemic and endemic diseases. In the case of lowerlevel healthcare resources, urbanisation is an important influencing factor, while economic development, population aging and morbidity have local effects. Ultimately, population density was the dominant factor. Finally, this paper suggests that, aiming for HDT reform, decision makers should allocate healthcare resources among different regions and levels in consideration of relevant global and local factors, united and targeted policies, and top-down and bottom-up decision-making mechanisms.

Thus, against the background of a changing climate, the climate- vegetation relationship is a hot topic in current global change research. Using geodetector, this study integrated climatic factors (e.g., average temperature, precipitation, water vapor pressure, humidity, sunshine hours, standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index), topographic factors (e.g., slope and elevation), and anthropogenic factors to determine the dominant factors that influenced the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the Beijing- Tianjin- Hebei region from 2006 to 2015.

This study revealed the temporal and spatial pattern of vegetation, and the response of vegetation to climate and non- climate factors over the past 10 years, and provided a reference for the construction and restoration of ecological engineering. Trend analysis showed that the NDVI increased during this period, albeit with differences on different spatial scales. In montane regions, the NDVI increased more rapidly than in plains, terraces, and hills. In different vegetation-covered areas, the NDVI increased most rapidly in broadleaf forest, followed by shrubland and coniferous forest. Based on the results of the quantitative distribution analysis, at the temporal scale of one year, precipitation was the dominant factor driving NDVI and explained 39.4% of the spatial distribution, while the interaction of rainfall and land use was the dominant interaction factor, with a q value of 0.582. We observed seasonal and regional differences in the response of NDVI to climatic factors. In the four seasons, vapour pressure was the dominant factor for the spatial distribution of NDVI; humidity is the dominant factor in summer and autumn; and in winter, land use was the dominant factor for NDVI distribution. The explanatory power of the influencing factors on NDVI in the growing season differed in diverse geomorphological types. In montane areas, with increasing elevation, the q value of average temperature decreased. The explanatory power of impacting factors on NDVI of the growing season was different among diverse vegetation types.

From the perspective of region uniqueness, it is critical to reveal the genesis (formation and evolution) and feedback (identification and planning) principles for MFZP. This paper takes Chongqing Municipality, a typical provincial unit in Southwest China, as an example to identify the suitable spatial pattern for MFZP by Territorial Space Development Conditions Comprehensive Evaluation (TSDCCE). Depending on perceptual observation of suitable pattern, this paper makes a dominant factors restriction hypothesis, defines the topography and urban location as the dominant factors, and then validates the correlation between dominant factors and Major Function- Oriented Zoning (MFOZ) index system. Then, based on the above analysis results, it discusses the restrictive and spatial stability mechanism originated from dominant factors for MFOZ. The results show that: (1) The spatial pattern of suitability is clear in terms of development or protection. The areas suitable for urbanization are mainly metropolitan regions and some surrounding counties, and sub- regional centers (Wanzhou and Qianjiang) also have relatively high suitability. The areas suitable for ecological protection are mainly located in the northeast and southeast of Chongqing, including Daba mountain area, Three Gorges Reservoir area and Wuling mountain area. (2) Topography and urban location factors dominate the MFOZ spatial pattern in this region. Regression analysis showed that more than 70% of the correlation between the MFOZ index and the topographic factor reached a significant level, while the correlation between the MFOZ index and urban location factor is over 40%. The significant levels (R2) of correlation between the weighting index (topography and urban location) and MFOZ flag variables (A and B index) are more than 0.8; The geographic detector finds that the topography's restriction on MFOZ indicators and urban location factors on that are 9 and 7, respectively, which reaches 0.05 significant level and the explanatory degrees for indicators A and B are about 70% and 60%, respectively. Then combining topography factor and urban location factor, it finds that restriction is obvious and the explanatory degrees for A and B are up to about 90%. (3) The spatial stability mechanism is shown in two aspects: one is the stability transfer mechanism based on the dominant factor's restriction, which is called objective stability; the other is the local relativity index system and the internal cancellation mechanism of the algorithm, namely, subjective stability. The coordination of the two mechanisms verifies the regional adaptability and correctness of the zoning technology system.", "abstract_ch": "主体功能区规划已上升为国家制度和战略,对中国长期空间发展格局优化与再组织将发挥积极的引导和约束作用。从地域性角度出发,探寻主体功能区发生性(形成与演化)和反馈性(识别与规划)时空机理与规律是地理学具有时代意义的重要科学问题。以重庆市为例,通过国土空间开发条件综合评价,识别了主体功能区划分的适宜性空间格局。基于对西南山区发展约束条件的基本认识,提出了地域主体功能空间分异的主导性约束假设,设定地形和区位为原生性主导因素,验证了其与区划指标系统的定量关联性,以此为基础解析了主导因素约束机理并提出了地域主体功能区的空间稳定性机制。研究发现:①开发与保护适宜性识别结果的格局指向清晰。城市化适宜的区域主要集中于都市区和部分周边区县,区域副中心(万州和黔江)适宜性也相对较高。生态保护适宜的区域集中于渝东北秦巴山区及部分三峡库区区县,同时包括渝东南武陵山区所在区县。②地形和区位因子在本区域对主体功能区的识别与形成具有主导约束作用。回归分析显示,主体功能区划指标与地形因子相关性水平达到显著的超过70%,区位因子超过40%;两者综合后与区划标志变量(A、B指数)的相线性相关拟合度R2均超过0.8;地理探测器发现,地形和区位因子对区划指标的约束性分别有9个和7个达到0.05显著性水平,对A、B指数的解释度分别约为70%和60%,两者叠加后,约束水平全部达到显著,对A、B指数的解释度在90%左右。③空间稳定性机制表现为两个方面,其一是基于主导因素约束的稳定性传递机制,称为客观稳定性;其二是基于指标体系的局域相对性和算法的内部抵消机制,称为主观稳定性。两种机制的协同性验证了区划技术系统的地域适应性和科学性。", "keywords_en": "Major Function-Oriented Zoning (MFOZ); dominant factor's restriction; spatial stability mechanism; geographic detector; Chongqing municipality", "keywords_ch": "主体功能区识别; 主导因素约束; 空间稳定性机理; 地理探测器; 重庆市", "address_en": "Wang Yang,School of Geography and Tourism, Chongqing Normal University;;Key Laboratory of GIS Application, Chongqing Municipal Education Commission;;The Three Gorges Reservoir Area Surface Processes and Remote Sensing Municipal Laboratory, ;;Key Laboratory of GIS Application, Chongqing Municipal Education Commission;;The Three Gorges Reservoir Area Surface Processes and Remote Sensing Municipal Laboratory, ;;;;, Chongqing;;Chongqing;;Chongqing 401331;;401331;;401331.Wang Lili,School of Geography and Tourism, Chongqing Normal University, Chongqing 401331.Qi Pengwei,School of Geography and Tourism, Chongqing Normal University, Chongqing 401331.Liu Zhihai,School of Geography and Tourism, Chongqing Normal University, Chongqing 401331.", "address_ch": "汪洋,重庆师范大学地理与旅游学院;;GIS应用研究重庆市高校重点实验室;;三峡库区地表过程与环境遥感重庆市重点实验室, ;;GIS应用研究重庆市高校重点实验室;;三峡库区地表过程与环境遥感重庆市重点实验室, ;;;;, 重庆;;重庆;;重庆 401331;;401331;;401331, 中国.王力力,重庆师范大学地理与旅游学院, 重庆 401331, 中国.祁鹏卫,重庆师范大学地理与旅游学院, 重庆 401331, 中国.刘志海,重庆师范大学地理与旅游学院, 重庆 401331, 中国.", "research_areas": "Business & Economics", "wos_categories": ""}

A high-precision Baidu migration process combined with mass relationships is applied in this study and enables the generation of regression coefficients of gravity model based on programmed large-scale regression simulations. A series of accuracy assessments are then developed for 2015 empirical projection daily regression coefficients that can be applied to Chinese spring interprovincial mobile gravity model variables as well as spatiotemporal research that utilizes regression coefficients within a heterogeneity research model. This approach also enables the error within the gravity model to be assessed in terms of floating population simulations. The results of this analysis lead to a number of clear conclusions, including the fact that parameter calibration complexity for the Chinese population mobility gravity model is reflected in the degree of influence asymmetry within spatial object interaction variables, and that the spatial heterogeneity of the variable regression coefficient increases in two distinct fashions. The first of these increases has to do with the overall influence of specific variables, including the fact that differences between proxies tend to be higher than inflowoutflow characteristics. In contrast, the second set of increases is related to economic levels, industrial scales, the proportion of the tertiary industry, and public service facilities. In this latter case, two-way population flow exerts a more profound influence on results and thus the scope of possible explanations for phenomena is more extensive. The regression coefficient for the existence of positive and negative proxy variables therefore relates to differences in spatial heterogeneity, including at the city level, and also assumes that floating population gravity model regression coefficients ignore spatiotemporal changes in the heterogeneity coefficient. This leads to spatial differences in estimated results and thus convergence trends, but further enables the identification of anisotropic interactions in extension space. The second main conclusion of this research is that the national scale population flow distance attenuation coefficient was 1.970 during the spring of 2015, while at the level of prefectural administrative units and given population outflow, the range encapsulated by this coefficient fell between 0.712 (Zhumadian) and 7.699 (Urumqi). Data also reveal a population inflow coefficient of 0.792 for this year that ranged as high as 8.223 in both Sanya and Urumqi. Population flow simulation results using the gravity model and including Baidu migration measured flow data were also subject to significant error. Third, the results of this analysis reveal a total fitting error of 85.54% in weighted absolute mean; the spatial interaction effect within this is responsible for a maximum error of 86.09% in actual and simulated flows, while relative outflow force and attractiveness encompass 57.73% and 49.34% of model error, respectively. These results show that the spatial interaction effect remains most difficult to model in terms of current factors.", "abstract_ch": "空间交互模型被广泛应用于地理要素关系强度的模拟,然而目前大量研究或建立在模型参数标定理想化、模式化的假设条件下,或是在暗箱中完成,由此导致模拟结果与实际的偏差却被严重低估。基于2015年中国春运期间人口省际流动的城市间O-D数据,在逐日、分市的研究精度下,实证推算人口流动重力模型变量的回归系数,探究模型代理变量影响效应的空间异质性,并评估重力模型在人口流动模拟上的误差。结果显示:①重力模型参数标定的复杂性体现在交互对象代理变量影响程度的非对称性,和变量回归系数的空间异质性随研究精度加深显著加剧两个方面,因此模型参数标定的模式化将导致估算结果空间差异的趋势收敛;② 2015年春运期间中国人口省际流动距离衰减系数为1.970,在地级行政单元视角下,人口流出地距离衰减系数值域为0.712(驻马店)~7.699(乌鲁木齐),人口流入地系数值域为0.792(三亚)~8.223(乌鲁木齐);③应用重力模型模拟人口流动结果与实测流(百度迁徙数据)存在显著误差。就加权绝对平均误差而言,拟合总误差为85.54%,其中空间相互作用效应造成了86.09%的实测流与模拟流的最大误差,相对流出力、相对吸引力分别造成57.73%、49.34%的模型误差。因此,空间交互效应仍然是当前最难以模式化的因素。", "keywords_en": "gravity model; regression coefficient; distance attenuation coefficient; error estimation; population flow; China", "keywords_ch": "重力模型; 回归系数; 距离衰减系数; 误差估算; 人口流动; 中国", "address_en": "Zhao Ziyu,Department of Public Administration, Ningbo University, Ningbo, Zhejiang 315211, China.Wei Ye,School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, Jilin 130024, China.Yang Ran,School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, Jilin 130024, China.Wang Shijun,School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, Jilin 130024, China.Zhu Yu,Institute of Geography, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, Fujian 350007, China.", "address_ch": "赵梓渝,宁波大学公共管理系, 宁波, 浙江 315211, 中国.魏冶,东北师范大学地理科学学院, 长春, 吉林 130024, 中国.杨冉,东北师范大学地理科学学院, 长春, 吉林 130024, 中国.王士君,东北师范大学地理科学学院, 长春, 吉林 130024, 中国.朱宇,福建师范大学地理研究所, 福州, 福建 350007, 中国.", "research_areas": "Sociology", "wos_categories": ""}

Simultaneously, network autocorrelation usually exists in population migration data(e.g., the spatial interaction among migration flows). The problems mentioned above result in biased estimation. In order to capture network autocorrelation and deal with the issue of overdispersion, we build an eigenvector spatial filtering negative binomial gravity model (ESF NBGM) based on the data of 1% national population sample survey in 2015, to analyze the driving mechanism of interprovincial population migration flows in China. The results are as follows: (1) Positive spatial spillover effect exists in interprovincial population migration flows, and ESF can capture network autocorrelation in data, so as to reduce the estimated deviation of the model. Furthermore, eigenvectors ranking top 1.4% can properly interpret the spatial pattern of high network autocorrelation in data. (2) There exists overdispersion in China's interprovincial migration flows. Considering this problem, a negative binomial regression model is more suitable for the estimation of driving mechanism for population migration, together with statistical enhancement. (3) Network autocorrelation leads to overestimation of distance variables and underestimation of non- distance variables. The results of the improved model reveal that: chief factors the affect driving mechanism are regional population characters, social network, economic development and education level. Meanwhile, living environment and road network gradually become one of the most crucial pulling factors that influence migration flows.

Based on the POI data in the central district of Changchun, this study focuses on four function categories: Residence, office, commerce, and leisure. Location quotient, entropy index, and Geodetector are used to explore the distribution features and influencing factors of mixed use in Changchun. Serveral conclusions are drawn as follows: (1) Mixed use is the major form of street scale function elements distribution, from the perspective of concentration. All types of elements form a functional gathering area of specialization, but there are large differences between the degrees of specialization. The distribution of concentration of functional elements shows consistent trends with the overall quantity distribution. (2) The degrees of mixed use performance of coreperiphery spatial differences reflects that the degree of the core street area a is higher than that of the external zone. The degrees of mixed use of office, commerce, and leisure is stronger than their mixture degree with residence. (3) The main features of mixed use at street scale are the mixed multi- functions compatible with each other. Among the various types of functional elements, leisure and commercial elements have a higher degree of interaction with others, which means that they have a strong compatibility, with the positive effect on mixed use. (4) The spatial heterogeneity of the degrees of mixed use is significant. The primary determinants of the spatial distribution of mixed use include: land price, number of leisure elements and commercial elements. The total number of functional elements, the density of population and the density of road network variables show a weak influence on the differentiation of multifunctional land use. Except that the land price varies, other influencing factors behave differently in the by-type mixed use impact mechanism.", "abstract_ch": "多功能要素的复合化已成为信息时代城市空间发展的重要趋势,而复合功能开发亦被认为是解决城市交通拥堵、低效能源消耗及职住不平衡等问题的重要手段,对促进有活力的、宜居的及可持续的城市环境建设具有重要意义。基于城市多样性的理论框架,在界定城市功能复合内涵的基础上,以长春市中心城区城市功能兴趣点(POI)数据为基础,采用区位熵指数、信息熵指数及地理探测器模型,分析城市居住、办公、商业、休闲四类功能要素的复合特征,并探讨城市功能复合空间分异的驱动因素。结果表明:①城市功能要素集中度特征显著,各类型功能要素均形成了专业化的功能集聚区,但各区块间功能要素的专业化程度存在较大差异。②城市功能要素复合度整体表现出核心边缘的空间差异,核心区街道复合度整体高于外围开发区,办公、商业、休闲三种功能要素间的复合度要整体强于其各自与居住功能的复合。③以单一功能为主、多功能兼容的综合型复合是街道尺度功能复合的主要表现形式;各功能要素中,休闲、商业功能具有较强的兼容性。④城市功能复合的空间异质性特征显著,土地价格、休闲要素数量是造成多功能复合分异的主要原因;分类型复合中,各解释因子影响力度表现各异。", "keywords_en": "urban diversity; mixed use; influencing factor; POI; Geodetector; Changchun", "keywords_ch": "城市多样性; 功能复合; 影响因素; POI数据; 地理探测器; 长春", "address_en": "Hao Feilong,School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, Jilin 130024, China.Shi Xiang,School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, Jilin 130024, China.Bai Xue,School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, Jilin 130024, China.Wang Shijun,School of Geographical Sciences, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, Jilin 130024, China.", "address_ch": "浩飞龙,东北师范大学地理科学学院, 长春, 吉林 130024, 中国.施响,东北师范大学地理科学学院, 长春, 吉林 130024, 中国.白雪,东北师范大学地理科学学院, 长春, 吉林 130024, 中国.王士君,东北师范大学地理科学学院, 长春, 吉林 130024, 中国.", "research_areas": "Business & Economics", "wos_categories": ""}

In recent years, the number of cases of HFMD in China has increased rapidly, and has received increasing attention. Although there are many related studies, only a few studies focus on the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of HFMD incidence and quantify the association between meteorological factors, socioeconomic variables, and HFMD incidence. Geodetector and Bayesian space-time hierarchical models were applied to analyze the spatiotemporal heterogen-eity of the HFMD incidence from 2009 to 2013 within the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region. These were used to quantify the determinant power of meteorological factors, socioeconomic variables, and the interactions between two of these factors. The Geodetector method has the axiom that if an explanatory variable (x) determined an explained variable (y), the explained variable would exhibit a spatial distribution similar to that of the explanatory variable. This method has been widely used to measure the determinant power of potential explanatory variables. The Bayesian space-time hierarchical model has the potential to show the spatiotemporal variation of a geographic phenomenon. The results showed that: (1) the highest incidence of HFMD occurred in late spring and summer (May to July), and the lowest incidence occurred in winter (December to February). (2) Spatial heterogeneity existed. In particular high risks areas were mainly concentrated in areas of high economic development. The population density and proportion of the tertiary industry determinants, play a lead role in contributing to the spatial heterogeneity of HFMD incidence (q values of 0.35 and 0.28, respectively, as calculated by GeoDetector). (3) The main meteorological factors affecting the temporal heterogeneity of HFMD incidence were average temperature, cumulative precipitation, and relative humidity (with a determinant powers calculated by GeoDetector of 0.38, 0.27 and 0.13, respectively). Additionally, the interactions were greater than the independent effects between socioeconomic variables or meteorological factors. For example, the interaction of average temperature and relative humidity, average temperature and precipitation, average temperature and wind speed were 0.43, 0.40 and 0.42, respectively. The interaction of population density and proportion of the tertiary industry was 0.55. This result presented the strongest correlation with HFMD incidence. Temperature and relative humidity were also dominant factors influencing the spatiotemporal transmission of HFMD, along with areas of high economic development with high population density.

A thorough understanding and quantitative identification of the influencing factors are essential for soil erosion protection and rocky desertification management. This study identifies the dominant factors (and interactions) influencing soil erosion and its spatiotemporal variability in a karst basin, the Sancha River Basin, China. The geographical detector method was used to conduct the quantitative attribution analysis, based on the modified universal soil loss equation model for karst environments. The results revealed that karst soil erosion exhibited a notable decreasing trend over the past 36 years (p < 0.01), decreasing from 16.70 t ha(-1) a(-1) in 1980 to 12.22 t ha(-1) a(-1) in 2015. The geographical detector results indicated significant differences in the strength of the association between influencing factors (or factor combinations) and karst soil erosion. Land use type was the dominant factor, followed by slope; a combination of land use type and slope was the dominant interaction factor, explaining at least 74% of the karst soil erosion distribution. Land use change dominated karst soil erosion dynamics in the 1980s and 1990s, and rainfall variability dominated in the 2000s. In addition, karst soil erosion showed high spatial heterogeneity, and the strength of the association differed substantially among diverse geomorphological types due to differences in the inner characteristics of each. These findings suggest that the characteristics of different geomorphological types should be considered for effective management and prevention of soil erosion at a regional level, and that steep croplands, especially with slopes higher than 15, should be prohibited in karst areas.

However, there are few historical fatal landslide catalogs available to quantitatively assess the impact as well as the temporal and spatial patterns of landslides. The Fatal Landslide Event Inventory of China (FLEIC), which spans from 1950 to 2016, was compiled based on multiple data sources. The inventory contains 1911 non-seismically triggered landslides, which resulted in a total of 28,139 deaths in China during 1950-2016. The occurrence frequency of fatal landslides presented significantly different trends for different grades of events. Very large fatal landslide events (fatalities > = 30) were on the rise during 1950-1999 and declined from 2000 to 2016. The decreasing trend after 2000 can be attributed to the increase in landslide mitigation investments. The small and medium-sized fatal landslide events (fatalities < 10) showed a significant increasing trend between 1950 and 2016, especially during the period of 2000-2016. This significant increasing trend is partly due to the improvement of the availability of landslide data online and may also be related to other factors including an increase in extreme precipitation events, the effects of land urbanization, and so on. This suggested that the inherent incompleteness of the landslide time series should be considered when analyzing. The fatal landslides mainly occurred between April and September (82.15%), which is consistent with the monthly precipitation variation in China. Spatially, most of the fatal landslides occurred in 14 provinces: five southwestern provinces (Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Chongqing), five southeastern provinces (Hunan, Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang), Shaanxi and Shanxi, Hubei and Gansu. These 14 provinces account for 86% of the total fatal landslides and their associated fatalities.

Records of more than 60000 FFDs are examined, and the centroid comparison method is used to reveal the spatiotemporal evolution of FFDs from 1951 to 2015. In particular, the geographical locations of the centroids, degrees of aggregation, and associated movement tendencies are examined to conduct a preliminary analysis of correlations between rainfall, population, and the spatiotemporal evolution of FFDs. Subsequently, using relevant data from 2000 to 2015, three factors relating to FFDs in natural watershed units include namely rainfall, human activity, and the environment of the Earth's surface. The geographical detector method is then employed to explore the effect of these driving factors on the spatial distribution of FFDs. Analysis results show that displacement of the spatial distribution of FFDs since 1949 is correlated with variations in rainfall and population distribution. In addition, it is determined that the distribution of FFDs occurring between 2000 and 2015 have regional differentiation characteristics. However, the effect of rainfall on the distribution of FFDs is more significant than that of human activity or the environment of the Earth's surface, but interactions occur between these latter two factors in disaster-formative environments. Furthermore, results also show that the driving factors of FFDs have significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. In China, regions at high risk of FFDs include the Sichuan-Chongqing ecological zone, the South China ecological zone, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, while regions with a low risk of FFDs include the Northwest China arid zone, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Inner Mongolian Plateau, and the Northeast China ecological zone.

Each risk might be influenced by multiple environmental factors and the factors' interaction within the specific system. Hence, health risk assessments of heavy metal contamination must consider multiple environmental media and their transfer processes from one medium to another. Integrated assessments provide a new perspective for evaluating many factors, such as the potential ecological risks of soils, sediments, plants, and the transportation of heavy metals in these media, which influences the health risks. In this study, the main influencing factors for human health risk from heavy metals along the Yangtze River in Nanjing, Southeast China, were explored. The contents of five heavy metals were measured in sediment-soil-plant, including cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and chromium (Cr). The Cd displayed the highest potential ecological risk in soils and sediments, as it possessed high bioaccessibility (BA; 0.17 +/- 0.211) and bioaccumulation factor (BCF; 0.35 +/- 0.33). The 5.97% of the target hazard quotient (THQ) of Cd were higher than 1, indicating a potential health risk in plant consumption. Based on the geodetector model, determinant power (DP) valves for factors influencing health risk strongly suggest that plant types (0.479) has a highest effect, followed by soil organic matter (SOM; 0.292), and the BA of heavy metals (0.107). The results also indicate that pollution from the upper reaches of the river, and agricultural activities, had a greater impact on health risk than did industrial activities in the study area.

This study employed the Hongsibu District as a typical example of ecological migration. Hongsibu District is located in the central Ningxia steppe and desert steppe areas. Remote sensing data covering five periods from the period before ecological migration in 1995 and after migration in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 was used to measure the value of ecosystem services (ESV). A geographical detector model and the value of ecosystem services model were used to diagnose the dynamic mechanism of the effects of land use change on ecosystem services. The results showed that: 1) The development of large-scale ecological resettlement has caused the area of cultivated land and urbanized land area to increase significantly in the area of immigration, while the grass area decreased significantly. 2) The overall value of the Hongsibu ecosystem services increased in a form of a V'. Among them, during the period of 1995-2005, the overall ESV decreased and had an annual rate of change of -0.67%. During the period of development 2005-2015, the ESV increased steadily, with an annual rate of change of 0.79%. 3) The proportion and total ESV in soil formation and protection, waste treatment, and biodiversity conservation of the Hongsibu District decreased from 57.61% in 1995 to 56.17% in 2015, indicating that the region's ecological regulation function slightly decreased. 4) The ESV in the Hongsibu District, showed a low distribution pattern of ecosystem services increasing from northeast to southwest, and the capacity of three townships, Hongsibu, Taiyangshan, and Liuquan, to provide ecosystem services gradually declined over time. The ecological service function of Xinzhuangji Township and Dahe Township gradually improved. 5) The sensitivity index of the ESV of each land use type was less than 1, indicating that the environment lacks flexibility in providing a strong ESV index in Hongsibu, which shows that the research results are reliable and believable. 6) During the study period, the decisive force of the change of land use on ecosystem services in Hongsibu District was: grassland (0.9934), climate regulation (0.9413), soil formation and protection (0.9321) and waste treatment (0.9241).", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "ecological migration;land use change;ecosystem services;geo-detector;arid area;Hongsibu district;BIODIVERSITY;PROVINCE;COUNTY;BASIN;ROAD", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Ningxia Univ, Sch Resources & Environm, Yinchuan 750021, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Key Lab China Arab Resource Evaluat & Environm Re, Yinchuan 750021, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Shaanxi Normal Univ, Sch Tourism & Environm, Xian 710062, Shaanxi, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Environmental Sciences & Ecology", "wos_categories": "Environmental Sciences"}

There are many concerns regarding the influence of each factor. However, a quantitative analysis to detect the interactions between factors is limited because of the complexity of the urban systems, especially the role of planning. Additionally, spatial heterogeneity is often overlooked. This study aims to improve and strengthen the knowledge in this field through a spatial statistical method known as GeoDetector. A new spatial quantification of urban expansion was presented in this study and the spatio-temporal characteristics and mechanism of urban growth in Beijing from 2010 to 2015 were also analyzed. The results show that urban expansion presents spatial heterogeneity with different grid cells, and the optimal scale was 4500 m.

In addition to pollutant emissions and meteorological conditions, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is also influenced by socioeconomic development. Thus, identifying the potential effects of socioeconomic development on PM2.5 variations can provide insights into particulate pollution control. This study applied spatial regression and the geographical detector technique for assessing the directions and strength of association between socioeconomic factors and PM2.5 concentrations, using data collected from 945 monitoring stations in 190 Chinese cities in 2014. The results indicated that the annual average PM2.5 concentrations is 61 +/- 20 mu g/m(3), and cites with more than 75 mu g/m(3) were mainly located in North China, especially in Tianjin and Hebei province. We also identified a marked seasonal variation in concentrations levels, with the highest level in winter due to coal consumption, lower temperatures, and less rainfall than in summer. Monthly variations followed a \"U-shaped\" pattern, with a down trend from January and an inflection point in September and then an increasing trend from October. The results of spatial regression indicated that population density, industrial structure, industrial soot (dust) emissions, and road density have a significantly positive effect on PM2.5 concentrations, with a significantly negative influence exerted only by economic growth. In addition, trade openness and electricity consumption were found to have no significant impact on PM2.5 concentrations. Using the geographical detector technique, the strength of association between the five significant drivers and PM2.5 concentrations was further analyzed. We found notable differences among the variables, with industrial soot (dust) emissions playing a greater role in the PM2.5 concentrations than the other variables.

Although many previous studies have employed various statistical methods to produce quantitative maps of the landslide susceptibility index (LSI) based on inventories of past landslides and contributing factors, they are mostly ad hoc to a specific area and their success has been hindered by the lack of a methodology that could produce the right mapping units at proper scale and by the lack of a general framework for objectively accounting for the differing contribution of various preparatory factors. This paper addresses these issues by integrating the geomorphon and geographical detector methods into LSM to improve its performance. The geomorphon method, an innovative pattern recognition approach for identifying landform elements based on the line of sight concept, is adapted to delineate ridge lines and valley lines to form slope units at self-adjusted spatial scale suitable for LSM. The geographical detector method, a spatial variance analysis method, is integrated to objectively assign the weights of contributing factors for LSM. Applying the new integrated approach to I-Lan, Taiwan produced very significant improvement in LSI mapping performance than a previous model, especially in highly susceptible areas.

The results showed that: (1) The number of settlements decreased nearly a quarter while their scale increased more than 1.2 times over the past 40 years, however, the number during 1975-1995 reduced more than that from 1995 to 2015, while the scale expansion was more significant during the period 1995-2015. (2) Restricted by mountain topography, the settlements were mainly distributed along the main roads and rivers like ribbons, as well as distributed along the county seat and township sites forming massive texture, and their evolution followed strong path dependence; The settlements tended to be located on low land, smaller topography, gentle slope and small relief, or more settlements concentrated in the hilly region, flat and slightly undulating topography, and the areas where the slope degree is less than 6° and the terrain niche index less than 0.4. In addition, the south slope directivity of settlements' location and the south slope, southeast slope and southwest slope directivity of settlement scale's spatial distribution was gradually strengthened. (3) The location of settlements was mainly affected by topography, production conditions and the radiation effects of roads, town centers, township sites as well as proximity to industrial and mining enterprises.

The study shows that: 1)The three types of land expansion modes coexist in the study area, in which outlying expansion is dominated by industrial and residential land, shifting from centralized distribution of new districts to radial expansion along traffic axles; The edge expansion is gradually shifted from residential land to industrial land, which is manifested as the reproductive effect of urban patches and continues to expand with the growth of urban space; the filling expansion is relatively inconspicuous, mainly based on residential land and concentrated in the old urban area. 2)transit-oriented development and top-down development model are the main characteristics of urban land expansion,The function mechanism of the different land expansion modes is different, accessibility and policy factors play a leading role in outlying expansion, aggregation factors are important factors that determine edge expansion, and aggregation and accessibility factors have a significant effect on the infilling expansion.", "abstract_ch": "城镇用地扩展是经济地理学和城市土地利用研究的经典领域。以赣州中心城区为例,利用景观扩张指数将其城镇用地扩展划分为飞地式、边缘式、填充式三类,同时结合用地功能探讨研究区2003~2016年城市扩展的空间分布特征,并借助地理探测器模型揭示不同用地扩展模式的差异化作用机理。研究表明:①研究区三类用地扩展模式并存,其中飞地式扩展以工业、居住用地为主,由新区组团式集中分布转向沿交通轴带放射状扩展;边缘式扩展由居住用地主导逐渐转向以工业用地为主,表现为城镇斑块的繁殖作用,随城市空间增长不断外延;填充式扩展相对不明显,以居住用地为主且集中分布于老城区。②交通引导开发及自上而下的开发模式是城区用地扩展的主要特征,不同用地扩展模式的作用机理具有差异性,通达性、政策性因子对飞地式扩展起主导作用;聚集性因子是决定边缘式扩展的重要因素;聚集性和通达性因子则对填充式扩展影响较为显著。", "keywords_en": "Urban Land; Expansion Mode; Characteristics; Mechanism; Ganzhou", "keywords_ch": "城镇用地; 扩展模式; 特征; 机理; 赣州", "address_en": "Wu Wei,;;, ;;, ;;, ;; 330022;;330022.Huang Cuiping,330022.Zhao Xiaojie,330022.Hu Xiying,330022.Wang Nan,330022.", "address_ch": "吴巍,江西师范大学城市建设学院;;鄱阳湖湿地与流域研究教育部重点实验室, ;;鄱阳湖湿地与流域研究教育部重点实验室, 南昌;;南昌, 江西;;江西 330022;;330022, 中国.黄翠萍,江西师范大学城市建设学院, 南昌, 江西 330022, 中国.赵晓杰,江西师范大学城市建设学院, 南昌, 江西 330022, 中国.胡细英,江西师范大学城市建设学院, 南昌, 江西 330022, 中国.王楠,江西师范大学城市建设学院, 南昌, 江西 330022, 中国.", "research_areas": "Business & Economics", "wos_categories": ""}

The main findings are the following : (1) The total amount of mountain-flood disasters in the Sichuan Province, from 1950 to 2015, remained stable and then increased rapidly. In addition, the catastrophe mainly occurred from May to September, especially in July every year. (2) The frequency of county disasters over Sichuan showed a decreasing trend from south to north. The average rainfall during historical mountain-flood disaster (ARD) increased exponentially from east to west, and decreased from middle to north. (3) From May to September each year and from1950s to 2010s, the center of gravity and the elliptical center of each standard deviation of the accumulated mountain-flood disaster are concentrated in the central part of Sichuan, moving to the northeast. The accumulated disaster points emerged in a pattern of southwest-northeast. (4) The spatial autocorrelation analysis indicates a positive spatial correlation between the amount of mountain-flood disaster and ARD in county area. (5) The geographic detector analysis indicates that natural factors, rainfall, human activity and other factors have a great influence on the temporal-spatial distribution of mountain-flood disaster. In particular, the main driving factors are the rainfall index, standard deviation of elevation and slope. The results provide a theoretical basis, scientific and technological support for the investigation of the temporal-spatial distribution characteristics of mountain-flood disaster in the Sichuan Province, which can also benefit the monitoring and early warning, the risk assessment, the prevention and control of mountain-flood disaster in small watersheds.", "abstract_ch": "山洪灾害时空分布规律及其影响因素,是灾害时空数据挖掘领域所关注的重点问题。本研究采用1950-2015年四川省历史山洪灾害事件数据,结合地统计、地理探测器、空间分析等方法,系统地分析了四川省1950-2015年历史山洪灾害的时空分布规律及其影响因素。结果表明:① 1950-2015年四川省山洪灾害数量整体呈先稳定后增长的趋势;山洪灾害主要集中在5-9月,7月覆盖率100%。②县域灾害频次在南-北方向呈递减分布趋势;平均降雨量(历史山洪灾害过程降雨的平均值)在东-西方向呈指数型增长趋势,南-北方向由中部向南北递减。③ 1950s-2010s和5-9月历史累计山洪灾害重心及各标准差椭圆中心集中在四川中部地区,向东北方向移动,累计灾害点空间分布呈西南-东北格局。④县域山洪灾害数量及平均降雨量呈空间正自相关。⑤地理探测器分析表明自然因素、降雨、人类活动等因素对山洪灾害时空分布影响较大,其中不同降雨指标、高程标准差、坡度是山洪灾害时空分布规律的主要驱动因素。研究结果对查清四川省山洪灾害时空分布特征及小流域山洪监测预警、风险评价、防治区划等提供坚实的理论基础和科技支撑。", "keywords_en": "mountain flood disaster; spatial and temporal distribution; spatial autocorrelation; geographic detector", "keywords_ch": "山洪灾害; 时空分布规律; 标准差椭圆; 空间自相关; 地理探测器", "address_en": "Xiong Junnan,School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Southwest Petroleum University;;Institute of Geographic and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, ;;State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Chengdu;;, ;;Beijing 610500;;100101.Zhao Yunliang,School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610500, China.Li Wei,School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu, Sichuan 610500, China.Cheng Weiming,Institute of Geographic and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Beijing 100101, China.Wang Nan,Institute of Geographic and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Beijing 100101, China.Guo Liang,Chinese Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research;;Research Center on Flood & Drought Disaster Reduction of the Ministry of Water Resources, ;;Research Center on Flood & Drought Disaster Reduction of the Ministry of Water Resources, ;;, Beijing;;Beijing 100038;;100038.", "address_ch": "熊俊楠,西南石油大学土木工程与建筑学院;;中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, ;;资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 成都;;, ;;北京 610500;;100101.赵云亮,西南石油大学土木工程与建筑学院, 成都, 四川 610500, 中国.李伟,西南石油大学土木工程与建筑学院, 成都, 四川 610500, 中国.程维明,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.王楠,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.郭良,中国水利水电科学研究院;;水利部防洪抗旱减灾工程技术研究中心, ;;水利部防洪抗旱减灾工程技术研究中心, ;;, 北京;;北京 100038;;100038, 中国.", "research_areas": "Engineering", "wos_categories": ""}

Identifying the spatial-temporal variation and predicting future trends are of great significance for estimating population accurately, making policy effectively, and warning of population booming timely. With the availability of data and the development of data processing technique, multisource data with both spatial and temporal features, such as mobile signaling data, have been used in population studies. In this paper, q-statistic was firstly applied as an exploratory analysis, then Bayesian spatial-temporal models were used to evaluate patterns of urban population and make prediction of future trends. The Chaoyang, Beijing in 2017 was selected as empirical study of this model. The spatially stratified heterogeneity was detected by q-statistic in Geodetector firstly. Then we explored the overall spatial variation, overall time trend and the departures of the local trends from the overall trend of resident population in Chaoyang by use of Bayesian spatial-temporal hierarchical model. Secondly, we applied Bayesian Gaussian predictive process to predict the resident population in December of 2017 by incorporating other relevant influential factors. The results show the perfect spatial stratified heterogeneity for resident population in Chaoyang, and the overall spatial variation demonstrates an increasing trend of population from center to the outside along the main ring road in Beijing. The overall time trend is still growing all over Chaoyang district, while the local trends, which departure from the overall trend of resident population, are different between each sub-districts in Chaoyang. Moreover, the spatial distribution of predicted resident population shows a high consistency with the observed resident population, and the prediction accuracy can be well accepted on the scale of Chaoyang district. However, prediction accuracy shows obvious difference on scale of sub-districts, with the worst prediction accuracy in the capital airport area. These findings show that Bayesian hierarchical model and Bayesian Gaussian predictive process are reliable in empirical study of population evaluation and prediction by effective application of multisource spatial-temporal data.

China is an agricultural country with a large but poor rural population. At the village level, poverty alleviation has the potential to affect millions of citizens. The Loess Plateau is a composite of fragile ecological environment and rural poverty communities. As a backward economy often twins with fragile ecology, studying poverty from a multidimensional perspective in tandem with spatial heterogeneity and its influencing factors can provide an effective analysis of poverty in regions with characteristics similar to those of the Loess Plateau. This study features Pengyang, which is a poverty-stricken county located on the Loess Plateau, and relies on the approach by Alkire and Foster to measure multidimensional poverty, using spatial autocorrelation, Geodetector, OLSR and quantile regression (QR) analysis. Results from our investigation show that the study area has a deep level of multidimensional poverty, with a Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) score of 0.045. The rates of health, housing, and education dimensions were 0.263, 0.245, and 0.227, respectively. Moran's I of MPI was 0.2, which indicates that multidimensional poverty was positively correlated with a spatial pattern of \"north, south, middle; high, high, low\". Using Geodetector, the mean distance between villages and the center of town, as well as the mean elevation of the villages and mean distance to a river, were found to be the main factors of spatial heterogeneity within the MPI. The q-values of them were 0.552, 0.396, and 0.326, respectively, and the result of regression analysis conforms to the Geodetector. The interaction of the above factors enabled the creation of a multidimensional poverty spatial heterogeneity mechanism at village level for the Loess Plateau, revealing a lack in welfare of farmers, the poor of infrastructure, the congenital deficiency and stalled development of industry, and weak government functioning at the township level. Our results suggest that new strategies regarding urbanization should be investigated in order to improve and ensure the quality of public services in areas with similar characteristic as the Loess Plateau. These new strategies could enable the resolution of problems from the root, such as designing public goods and services that fill gaps in current health care and housing options, as well as the operation of transport facilities at the village level. This could help to mitigate welfare loss of farmers as well as reduce the negative impact of health, housing, education, and other dimensions of poverty.", "abstract_ch": "黄土高原属于生态环境脆弱与农村经济贫困的复合区域,研究其村域多维贫困及空间异质性有助揭示乡村贫困原因及空间格局。以宁夏彭阳县为研究区,运用A-F法对村域多维贫困进行测度,并结合空间自相关、地理探测器和回归分析方法对其空间异质性进行了系统分析。结果表明:①研究区农户多维贫困程度较深,K= 3时,多维贫困指数(MPI)为0.045,平均剥夺份额0.361,主要致贫维度是住房、健康和教育,贡献率分别为0.263、0.245、0.227,收入维度贡献率仅占0.130;② MPI空间自相关Moran's I值为0.2,即存在正相关,呈现南北高,中部低的格局;③地理探测器结果显示行政村到镇中心的距离、村平均高程、村委会到主要河流的距离是影响MPI空间异质性的主要因子,其决定力q值分别为0.552、0.396、0.326,且在最小二乘线性回归(OLSR)和分位数回归(QR)中均通过了1%的显著性检验;④各因子间的相互作用形成了黄土高原农户福利缺失、基础设施落后与产业发展受阻、乡镇政府职能被削弱的村域多维贫困空间分异机制。⑤最后提出推进新型城镇化建设,实现公共服务均等化,从根源上解决农村医疗、住房、交通设施落后等难题的建议。", "keywords_en": "multidimensional poverty; spatial heterogeneity; Geodetector; quantile regression; Loess Plateau", "keywords_ch": "多维贫困; 空间异质性; 地理探测器; 分位数回归; 黄土高原", "address_en": "Wen Qi,School of Resources and Environment, Ningxia University;;Key Laboratory (China-Arab) of Resource Evaluation and Environmental Regulation of Arid Region in Ningxia, ;;Key Laboratory (China-Arab) of Resource Evaluation and Environmental Regulation of Arid Region in Ningxia, Yinchuan;;Yinchuan, ;; 750021;;750021.Shi Linna,School of Resources and Environment, Ningxia University;;Key Laboratory (China-Arab) of Resource Evaluation and Environmental Regulation of Arid Region in Ningxia, ;;Key Laboratory (China-Arab) of Resource Evaluation and Environmental Regulation of Arid Region in Ningxia, Yinchuan;;Yinchuan, ;; 750021;;750021.Ma Caihong,School of Resources and Environment, Ningxia University;;Key Laboratory (China-Arab) of Resource Evaluation and Environmental Regulation of Arid Region in Ningxia, ;;Key Laboratory (China-Arab) of Resource Evaluation and Environmental Regulation of Arid Region in Ningxia, Yinchuan;;Yinchuan, ;; 750021;;750021.Wang Yongsheng,Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.", "address_ch": "文琦,宁夏大学资源环境学院;;宁夏(中阿)旱区资源评价与环境调控重点实验室, ;;宁夏(中阿)旱区资源评价与环境调控重点实验室, 银川;;银川, ;; 750021;;750021.施琳娜,宁夏大学资源环境学院;;宁夏(中阿)旱区资源评价与环境调控重点实验室, ;;宁夏(中阿)旱区资源评价与环境调控重点实验室, 银川;;银川, ;; 750021;;750021.马彩虹,宁夏大学资源环境学院;;宁夏(中阿)旱区资源评价与环境调控重点实验室, ;;宁夏(中阿)旱区资源评价与环境调控重点实验室, 银川;;银川, ;; 750021;;750021.王永生,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 北京 100101, 中国.", "research_areas": "Agriculture", "wos_categories": ""}

Based on landscape pattern index, principal component analysis, GeoDetector and platforms of GIS and RS, the spatio-temporal change and driving factors of the landscape fragmentation were quantitatively analyzed in Bailongjiang watershed of Gansu Province from 1990 to 2014. The results showed that: 1) The change regularity of landscape pattern indices showed that the degree of landscape fragmentation increased firstly and then decreased from 1990 to 2014. To be specific, Edge Density(ED) and Shannon's Diversity Index(SHDI) of the watershed showed the trend of increase firstly and then decrease, which indicated that the landscape of the watershed developed from irregularity to regularity in edge shape and the diversity of landscape types enhanced firstly and then weakened. Contagion Index(CONTAG) of the watershed showed the situation of decreased firstly and then increased, which suggested that reunion degree of different patch types changed from weak to strong, the higher the CONTAG, the better connectivity, otherwise, there were more small patches, representing higher fragmentation. Landscape Division Index (DIVISION) showed a slight downward trend. 2) In general, landscape fragmentation is affected by human activities, and counties or districts scale can better reflect human activities. The scale analysis of counties or districts showed that the degree of landscape fragmentation increased dramatically in Wenxian and Wudu during 1990-2002 and decreased significantly in Wenxian during 2002-2014.3) Landscape fragmentation degree of the southeastern watershed (mainly in Wenxian and Wudu) enhanced firstly and then weakened and the variation tendency was most intense and complicated. 4) Taking 2014 as an example, this article explored the driving factors of landscape fragmentation based on GeoDetector. The outcome of ecological detector deemed that there were striking differences between land use types and elevation, slope, and aspect, and so did human activities intensity, nevertheless, land use types and human activities intensity had no difference, which illustrated that human disturbance (i.e. land use types and human activities intensity) and topographic factors (i.e. elevation, slope and aspect) had different effects on the spatial differentiation of landscape fragmentation. Moreover, the result of factor detector showed that human disturbance had the highest ability to explain the spatial differentiation of landscape fragmentation which meant human interference was the momentous driving factor.

Results show that the scaling farmland was mainly converted from cultivated land and shrubland. Apart from some land used for alpine off-season vegetables, the growth of scaling farmland generally occurred at low altitude, and was mainly found in the range with a slope of 30°. The spatial change of scaling farmland of different types was significantly different, which was closely related with road and township administrative center. At the patch level, natural factors such as elevation and slope contribute much to the scaling farmland. At the township level, the driving forces of socioeconomic and humanistic factors were attributed to road traffic, agricultural population density and so on. At the regional level, the influencing factors of each county were more significant than those of the study area. The change and development of scaling farmland was driven by many factors.

However, studies on the multifactor synthesis are still insufficient. In this study, the simulation of soil erosion and its quantitative attribution analysis have been conducted in different morphological types of geomorphology in a typical karst basin based on the RUSLE model and the geographical detector method. The influencing factors, such as land use type, slope, rainfall, elevation, lithology and vegetation cover, have been taken into consideration. Results show that the strength of association between the six influencing factors and soil erosion was notably different in various morphological types of geomorphology. Land use type and slope were the dominant factors of soil erosion in the Sancha River Basin, especially for land use type whose power of determinant (q value) for soil erosion was much higher than that of other factors. The q value of slope declined with the increase of relief in mountainous areas, namely it was ranked as follows: middle elevation hill > small relief mountain > middle relief mountain. Multi-factor interactions were proven to significantly strengthen soil erosion, particularly for the combination of land use type with slope, which can explain 70% of soil erosion distribution. It can be found that soil erosion in the same land use type with different slopes (such as dry land with a slope of 5°and dry land with slopes above 25°) or in the diverse land use types with the same slopes (such as dry land with a slope of 5° and forest with a slope of 5°), varied greatly. This indicates that prohibiting steep slope cultivation and the Grain for Green Project are reasonable measures to harness soil erosion in karst areas. Based on statistics of soil erosion difference between diverse stratifications of each influencing factor, results of risk detector suggest that the amount of stratification combinations with significant difference accounted for 55% at least in small and middle relief mountains.

However, the power of determinant (PD), measuring data association based on the variance of the dependent variable within zones of a potential controlling factor, does not explicitly consider the spatial characteristics of the data and is also influenced by the number of levels into which each continuous factor is discretized. Here, we propose an improved spatial data association estimator (termed as SPatial Association DEtector, SPADE) to measure the spatial data association by the power of spatial and multilevel discretization determinant (PSMD), which explicitly considers the spatial variance by assigning the weight of the influence based on spatial distribution and also minimizes the influence of the number of levels on PD values by using the multilevel discretization and considering information loss due to discretization. We illustrate our new method by applying it to simulated data with known benchmark association and to dissection density data in the United States to assess its potential controlling factors. Our results show that PSMD is a better measure of association between spatially distributed data than the original PD.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Geographical detector;spatial association;multilevel discretization;spatial variance;DRAINAGE DENSITY;RISK-ASSESSMENT;GRAVITY MODEL;CHINA;SURFACE;DISCRETIZATION;MORPHOLOGY;LANDSCAPE;EVOLUTION;LANDFORMS", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Geog & Atmospher Sci, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Computer Science; Geography; Physical Geography; Information Science & Library Science", "wos_categories": "Computer Science, Information Systems; Geography; Geography, Physical; Information Science & Library Science"}

As a key area of rapid urbanization and agglomeration of production and living factors, the land use of rural settlements in metropolitan areas changes rapidly and complicatedly, which has become an important content of research. This study divided the rural settlements into five categories and then analyzed the spatial distribution of rural land non-agricultural degree in Guangzhou City in 2013 using correlated index and GIS. The results show that: (1) Rural land non-agricultural degree decreases with the distance between a rural settlement and the metropolitan area, and increases from the outer suburb to the inner suburb. (2) There is a significant correlation between the rural land non- agricultural degree and the development level of the district centers. The distribution of non-agriculture land in inner suburb areas is zonal spread while the distribution in outer suburb areas is along the main roads.

and treatment needs to be solved urgently.In the process of urbanization,balancing the three types of land for construction land,sandy land and ecological land is particularly important.Based on the GD_SVM_CA-Markov model,this paper aims to analyze the change of the dynamic distribution of the landscape in Dengkou county from two dimensions of time and space,to explore its change pattern,and carry on the simulation prediction,so as to provide a certain decisionmaking reference for the local urban development planning,the desertification control and the ecological environment protection.[Methods]Based on 10 driving factors(DEM,slope,aspect,NDVI,groundwater depth,evapotranspiration,population density,the nearest distance to water area,the nearest distance to settlement,the nearest distance to road),the land use suitability atlas was created by using GeoDetector to explore the relationship between land use change and 10 driving factors and MCE module provided by IDRISI software;Through SVM to define the transformation rules of the cell,thus the improvement of CA model was achieved;Based on the land use data of the two periods of 2006 and 2011,the Markov model was used to generate the land use transfer matrix.The landscape pattern simulation of study area in 2016 based on the GD_SVM_CA-Markov model was implemented with the above process integrated.In order to test the simulation accuracy,the Kappa coefficient was used for the test [Results]From 2006 to 2016,the landscape area of construction land in Dengkou county increased from 5 785.55 hm~2 to 8 952.67 hm~2,the landscape area of sandy land decreased from 76 616.15 hm~2 to 56 460.50 hm~2,the landscape area of water area increased from 23 859.88 hm~2 to 24 679.10 hm~2,the landscape area of woodland and grassland increased from 117 452.37 hm~2 to 128 120.87 hm~2.For construction land,there was 15.64% probability of conversion to arable land.In the case of water area,there was 11.56% probability of turning into arable land.In terms of sandy land,there was 18.37% probability of turning into woodland and grassland.The influence degree of the 10 driving factors on the landscape type change in Dengkou county was 0.248 816,0.048 784,0.134 342,0.951 212,0.975 924,0.873 667,0.520 317,0.256 226,0.413 550,0.178 658 respectively according to the above order.The Kappa coefficient of the CA-Markov model simulation results of 2016 was 0.862 8,the Kappa coefficient of the GD_SVM_CA-Markov model simulation result of 2016 was 0.925 0.Based on the land use data of 2016 and the land use transfer data of 20112016,the GD_ SVM_CA-Markov model was used to simulate and predict the spatial distribution pattern of landscape in 2021.During 20162021,the landscape area of construction land increased from 8 952.67 hm~2 to 11 610.21 hm~2,the landscape area of sandy land increased from 56 460.50 hm~2 to 67 235.11 hm~2,and the landscape area of ecological land such as water area and woodland and grassland decreased from 152 799.97 hm~2 to 143 670.04 hm~2.[Conclusions]Hydrological conditions,vegetation cover and population factor are the decisive factors that determine the temporal and spatial changes of local landscape types.Thus,at the same time as urban development,it is necessary to pay attention to ecological and environmental protection.The simulation result of 2016 based on GD _ SVM _

The main conclusions are as follows. 1) The spatial differentiation of Chinese digital economic development is obvious. The development level of digital economy and its four dimensions is decreasing from east to west at the provincial level, at the same time, there are new poles of innovation and development in Sichuan, Chongqing and so on. At the urban scale, national urban agglomeration area is the absolute height of the development of digital economy, such as Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration, the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration, the Pearl River Delta Urban Agglomeration. 2) There are both coordinated development and differentiation among the various dimensions of the digital economy, and the differences between the four plates of the East, Middle, West and Northeast China and their interior are obvious, especially between the eastern region and the other three regions. 3) The dominant factors influencing the development of digital economy at different spatial scales are different. At the national level, the government's commitment to science and technology plays an important role. However, the factors influencing the development of the digital economy in the eastern region are quited, and all the factors are independent. And the influence of informatization foundation and potential factors plays a leading role in the development of digital economy in Central China, and the interaction force of each factor is obviously strengthened. However, there is no decisive factor in the western region, which is affected by many factors. The factors influencing the development of digital economy in Northeast China are relatively single.

Therefore,it is necessary and practical to study the influencing factors and formation mechanism of agglomeration ability of urban agglomeration in the context of the current urbanization development into the context of urban agglomeration as a spatial competitive entity. Based on this,we discussed the influencing factors and formation mechanism of resources aggregating ability in UAMRYR by using the geographic detector method and taking 31 cities in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River as the research object. Research shows that: ① The innovation level of science and technology,the level of economic development, urban scale,employment opportunities,the level of opening to the outside,the market level,the wage level and so are the main influencing factors of resources aggregating ability in UAMRYR ,and their effect tends to enhance from 1995 to 2014. ②There are not only individual interaction relationships between the influencing factors,but also complex interaction mechanisms,which dominate the formation and evolution of resource aggregating ability. ③ The agglomeration of resources is the inevitable result of theprofit seeking' of resources,good market development and opening policy are important preconditions to improve the resources aggregating ability of cities,scientific and technological innovation are the accelerator to increase the rate of return of resources agglomeration,the population size is reflected in resource gathering capabilities,traffic flow,information flow,capital flow and other resources to gather support resources agglomeration channel are thelifeline',education,medical,cultural and other public service supporting service system are important support for resource gathering,but living cost,tax cost play the role of counterforce in the process of resource agglomeration.", "abstract_ch": "区域发展有赖于各种资源的有力支撑和资源在空间上的优化配置,然而由于稀缺性,使得资源的非均衡分布和流动成为其基本特征。城市群作为大范围内资源的高密度聚集区,是资源集聚的最佳场所和资源优化配置的自然结果。因此,在当前城市化发展转入以城市群为空间竞争实体的背景下,研究城市群资源集聚能力的影响因素与形成机理具有必要性和现实意义。基于此,本文以长江中游城市群31个城市为研究对象,运用研究空间分布差异的地理探测器方法对资源集聚能力的影响因素和形成机理进行了分析。研究发现:①科技创新水平、经济发展水平、人口规模、就业机会、对外开放水平、市场化水平、工资水平等是影响长江中游城市群资源集聚能力演化的主要因素,且19952014年这些因子对资源集聚能力的影响作用不断增强;②各影响因子间不仅存在双向交互作用关系,还存在复杂的交互耦合作用关系,共同支配着资源集聚能力的形成和演化; ③资源集聚是资源逐利性作用下的必然结果,良好的市场发育和对外开放政策是提高城市(群)资源集聚能力的重要前提,科技创新是提高资源集聚回报率的加速器,人口规模是资源集聚能力的体现,交通流、信息流、资金流等资源集聚通道是保障资源集聚的生命线,教育、医疗、文化等公共服务配套服务体系是资源集聚的重要支撑,而生活成本、税收成本等因素在资源集聚过程中扮演了反作用力的角色。", "keywords_en": "UAMRYR; resources aggregating ability; influencing factors; formation mechanism", "keywords_ch": "长江中游城市群; 资源集聚能力; 影响因素; 形成机理", "address_en": "Guo Qingbin,School of Business,Hubei University, Wuhan, Hubei 430062, China.Xu Yang,School of Economics and Management, Hubei University of Science and Technology, Xianning, Hubei 437100, China.Liu Chengliang,School of Urban and Regional Science, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200062, China.", "address_ch": "郭庆宾,湖北大学商学院, 武汉, 湖北 430062, 中国.许泱,湖北科技学院经济与管理学院, 咸宁, 湖北 437100, 中国.刘承良,华东师范大学城市与区域科学学院, 上海 200062, 中国.", "research_areas": "Geography", "wos_categories": ""}

Evaluating the spatiotemporal variations that result from land use changes can therefore provide the scientific basis for regional ecological protection and land management. Thus, taking Yuzhong County as a case study, which is located in the transitional area of the Three Natural Zones, this paper examines the spatiotemporal characteristics of habitat quality and its evolution over the period between 1995 and 2015 based on coefficient of variation and Taylor index. Choosing 14 explanatory variables, such as rainfall, distance to the county center, and area of land remediation, this paper explores by means of geographic detector analysis the factors that influence habitat quality and its evolution across a range of different spatial levels. The results of this analysis reveal that, in the first place, habitat quality throughout the whole county has remained stable and has improved slightly over the last 20 years. However, due to variations in natural and socioeconomic conditions, internal changes in habitat quality within the three sub-regions considered in this study are different from one another, consistent with an overall decrease along a south-north transect. Secondly, the differences in habitat quality between the three regions, as compared to the differences within them, have tended to decrease over time. Over the period of this analysis, variations in habitat quality continued to increase on the Loess Plateau in the north, declined continuously in the Middle Plain Area, and initially descended then ascended in the Southern Mountain Area. Thirdly, geographic scale is an important component that must be considered for evaluating habitat quality changes, as factors and mechanisms vary at different levels. Natural environmental variables play a fundamental role in habitat quality changes; on the other hand, the effect of socioeconomic variables on habitat quality has become weaker over time, whereas the effect of policy variables has become greater. Furthermore, synergism occurs amongst the different factors.

To solve these problems, using multiple regression and the geographic detector, we synthetically detected the influence of terrain, landform, land use, traffic location and other factors on economic differences among typical poor counties and affluent counties in Jiangxi Province and analyzed the influence, interaction and instruction of various factors. The results show that: (1) The 9 selected geographical environment factors all have an impact on the economy of poor counties and affluent counties, and different factors have different influence and the dominant factors are also different between the two types of countries. (2) Poor counties are mainly affected by natural conditions and geographical location and affluent counties are mainly affected by resource abundance and traffic location.

The correlation and interaction of spatial distributions of heavy metals and 6 factors, as well as that of five heavy metals, were studied.【Result】 The results showed that Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the average temperature and relative humidity had a greater explanatory power to the five kinds of soil heavy metals to (P_(D, H) values are above 0.5). Soil pH, soil type, elevation and soil heavy metals were less explanatory (P_(D,H) values below 0.3). The soil type had the lowest explanatory power to five kinds of soil heavy metals (P_(D,H) values were below 0.1). Among the five soil heavy metals, Cr has the strongest explanatory effect on Cd (P_(D,H) = 0.95), and As is the least (P_(D,H) = 0.20). The effects of average temperature, relative humidity and GDP on soil heavy metals were significantly higher than those of other Influence factors, while the difference of explanatory power between other influence factors was not significant. There are mutually reinforcing or non-linear enhancement effects between the Influence factors and between the five heavy metal elements. [Conclusion] The spatial distribution of heavy metals in soil is the result of the interaction of multiple influence factors.

Therefore, it is important to identify the spatial heterogeneity and influencing factors of PM_(2.5) concentration for the purpose of regional air quality control and management.

The main findings are as follows: (1) In general, the average concentration of PM_(2.5) in China has increased quickly and reached its peak value in the year of 2006; after that, it has been maintained at around 22.47- 28.26 mug/m~3. (2) PM_(2.5) is strikingly uneven in China, with a higher concentration in North and East than in South and West, respectively. In particular, the areas with a relatively high concentration of PM_(2.5) are mainly the four regions including the Huang- Huai- Hai Plain, the Lower Yangtze River Delta Plain, the Sichuan Basin, and the Taklimakan Desert. Among them, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region has the highest concentration of PM_(2.5). (3) The center of gravity of PM_(2.5) has shown an overall eastward movement trend, which indicates an increasingly serious haze in eastern China. Particularly, the center of gravity of high-value PM_(2.5) is kept on moving eastward, while that of the low-value PM_(2.5) moves westward. (4) The spatial autocorrelation analysis indicates a significantly positive spatial correlation. The \"High- High\" PM_(2.5) agglomeration areas include the Huang- Huai- Hai Plain, Fenhe-Weihe River Basin, Sichuan Basin, and Jianghan plain regions. The \"Low-Low\" PM_(2.5) agglomeration areas include Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang to the north of the Great Wall, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and Taiwan, Hainan and Fujian and other southeast coastal and island areas. (5) Geographic detection analysis indicates that both natural and human factors account for the spatial variations of PM_(2.5) concentration. In particular, factors such as natural geographical location, population density, automobile quantity, industrial discharge and straw burning are the main driving forces of PM_(2.5) concentration in China.", "abstract_ch": "高浓度PM_(2.5)是形成雾霾的主要原因之一,科学识别PM_(2.5)浓度的空间异质性与驱动因素对区域大气联动治理意义重大。研究采用2000-2011年NASA大气遥感影像反演的PM_(2.5)数据,结合地统计、地理探测器及GIS空间分析等方法,系统分析了中国2000-2011年PM_(2.5)浓度时空演化格局特征与其驱动因素。结果表明:① 2000-2011年中国PM_(2.5)污染平均浓度一直保持在22.47~28.26 mug/m~3区间,总体呈现先快速增加后趋于稳定的演化态势,2006年是PM_(2.5)浓度值变化的拐点(峰值)。②空间上PM_(2.5)浓度整体呈现北方高于南方,东部高于西部趋势,污染浓度高值区集中分布在黄淮海平原、长三角下游平原、四川盆地与塔克拉玛干沙漠四大区域,其中京津冀地区污染最为严重。③污染浓度重心研究表明PM_(2.5)重心总体呈现快速东移趋势,污染高值区持续向东移动,低值区向西移动,两者重心背向而行,表明东部雾霾污染程度在进一步加剧。④空间自相关分析表明PM_(2.5)年均浓度呈现强烈的局部空间正自相关特性,PM2.5高高集聚区连片分布在黄淮海平原、汾渭盆地、四川盆地及江汉平原地区,PM2.5低低集聚区分布在长城以北的内蒙古、黑龙江、青藏高原、以及台湾、海南与福建等东南沿海及岛屿地区。 ⑤地理探测分析表明气候等自然因素与人类活动共同对PM_(2.5)浓度空间变化产生巨大影响,其中自然地理区位、人口密度、汽车数量、工业烟尘、秸秆燃烧等因子是中国PM_(2.5)浓度空间变化的主要驱动因素。", "keywords_en": "PM_(2.5); PM_(2.5); air pollution; tempo-spatial evolution; geographical detector; China", "keywords_ch": "大气污染; 空间演化; 地理探测器; 中国", "address_en": "Zhou Liang,State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Zhou Chenghu,State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Sun Dongqi,State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Yang Fan,School of Geographic and Oceanographic Sciences, Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210093, China.Wang Bo,Department of Geography, The University of Hong Kong, 999077, Hong Kong.", "address_ch": "周亮,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.周成虎,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.孙东琪,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.杨帆,南京大学地理与海洋科学学院, 南京, 江苏 210093, 中国.王波,香港大学地理系, 999077, 香港.", "research_areas": "Environmental Sciences & Ecology", "wos_categories": ""}

Then the paper collected crop planting data to calculate and test the spatio-temporal characteristics in grain loss through estimation model on grain loss, defining grain loss rate and geodetector. The conclusions of paper are: (1)compared with the curve of disaster- affected areas, disaster intensity index constructed in this paper could better present temporal changes of natural disasters; (2)China alternately suffered from flood and drought between 1949 and 2015 and in the coming 5 to 10 years the main suffering would be flood; (3)the ranking of natural disasters is: drought>flood>low temperature >hail>typhoon, among which, the areas affected by drought and flood occupied more than half of the total; (4)natural disasters show clear spatial characteristics and the ranking of regional areas prone to disasters is: eastern region>western region; northern region >southern region. Generally speaking, northern region is prone to only one particular natural disaster while southern region tends to suffer from several natural disasters in the meantime; (5)the sum of natural disasters, drought, hail and low temperature, with their random distribution in space, presented unclear spatial autocorrelation, while flood and typhoon, with their clustering model in space distribution, showed clear spatial autocorrelation; (6)from 1949 to 2015, the general temporal changes of disasters, grain loss amount and loss rate showed a feature that the figures would rise first, and then dropped with the critical point in 2000. Meanwhile, they had significant heterogeneity in spatial distribution, great difference in single- factor explanation power, and multi- factor interaction showed a nonlinear enhancement relation. The distribution of hot and cold spots on both sides of the Hu Line presented a polarization pattern and the gravity center of grain loss gradually moved northward. Accordingly, this paper proposes that our government should adopt different precautionary measures in different regions of China: measures against drought and hail in Northwest China; measures against drought and waterlogging in Northeast China; measures against flood and low temperature in Central China; measures against waterlogging and typhoon in coastal areas of Southeast China.

The correlation and interaction of spatial distributions of heavy metals and 6 factors, as well as that of five heavy metals, were studied.【Result】 The results showed that Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the average temperature and relative humidity had a greater explanatory power to the five kinds of soil heavy metals to (P_(D, H) values are above 0.5).

The main findings are as follows: (1) In general, the average concentration of PM_(2.5) in China has increased quickly and reached its peak value in the year of 2006; after that, it has been maintained at around 22.47- 28.26 mug/m~3. (2) PM_(2.5) is strikingly uneven in China, with a higher concentration in North and East than in South and West, respectively. In particular, the areas with a relatively high concentration of PM_(2.5) are mainly the four regions including the Huang- Huai- Hai Plain, the Lower Yangtze River Delta Plain, the Sichuan Basin, and the Taklimakan Desert. Among them, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region has the highest concentration of PM_(2.5). (3) The center of gravity of PM_(2.5) has shown an overall eastward movement trend, which indicates an increasingly serious haze in eastern China. Particularly, the center of gravity of high-value PM_(2.5) is kept on moving eastward, while that of the low-value PM_(2.5) moves westward. (4) The spatial autocorrelation analysis indicates a significantly positive spatial correlation. The \"High- High\" PM_(2.5) agglomeration areas include the Huang- Huai- Hai Plain, Fenhe-Weihe River Basin, Sichuan Basin, and Jianghan plain regions. The \"Low-Low\" PM_(2.5) agglomeration areas include Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang to the north of the Great Wall, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and Taiwan, Hainan and Fujian and other southeast coastal and island areas. (5) Geographic detection analysis indicates that both natural and human factors account for the spatial variations of PM_(2.5) concentration.

Firstly, a large number of real estate listing information and transaction data existing in different real estate business website had been obtained by web crawler technology. Secondly, the correlation between housing listing price and transaction price was tested using a linear regression model and the usability of ubiquitous online real estate data had been validated. Thirdly, a multi-scale grid model of mixed pixels was proposed, which was based on the description of the statistical characteristics of the real estate, and the problem of multi-source data fusion was solved. Moran's I and Geo-detector were used to analyze the geographic spatial autocorrelation and non-homogeneity of housing listing price. The spatial raster database of long term real estate was constructed based on the combination of adjacent spatio-temporal interpolation and P-Bshade interpolation. Finally, the inner part of Beijing Six Ring Road was selected as the study area. We analyzed the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of second-hand housing prices by grid partition algorithm. Overall, we explored the real time dynamic analysis method of real estate. The results showed that: in the first half of 2016, the growth rate of second-hand housing price was larger, and the latter half of the growth was relatively flat. The spatial distribution of second-hand housing price in Beijing was dominated by a single center pattern. At the same time, there are distributions of high island area.

By means of Python Programming Language and on the basis of grain production loss over Chinese 31 provinces from 1949 to 2015, this paper first constructed disaster intensity index to analyze temporal features of different natural disasters, and with trend analysis as well as ESDA to analyze spatial characteristics in different provinces. Then the paper collected crop planting data to calculate and test the spatio-temporal characteristics in grain loss through estimation model on grain loss, defining grain loss rate and geodetector. The conclusions of paper are: (1)compared with the curve of disaster- affected areas, disaster intensity index constructed in this paper could better present temporal changes of natural disasters; (2)China alternately suffered from flood and drought between 1949 and 2015 and in the coming 5 to 10 years the main suffering would be flood; (3)the ranking of natural disasters is: drought>flood>low temperature >hail>typhoon, among which, the areas affected by drought and flood occupied more than half of the total; (4)natural disasters show clear spatial characteristics and the ranking of regional areas prone to disasters is: eastern region>western region; northern region >southern region. Generally speaking, northern region is prone to only one particular natural disaster while southern region tends to suffer from several natural disasters in the meantime; (5)the sum of natural disasters, drought, hail and low temperature, with their random distribution in space, presented unclear spatial autocorrelation, while flood and typhoon, with their clustering model in space distribution, showed clear spatial autocorrelation; (6)from 1949 to 2015, the general temporal changes of disasters, grain loss amount and loss rate showed a feature that the figures would rise first, and then dropped with the critical point in 2000. Meanwhile, they had significant heterogeneity in spatial distribution, great difference in single- factor explanation power, and multi- factor interaction showed a nonlinear enhancement relation. The distribution of hot and cold spots on both sides of the Hu Line presented a polarization pattern and the gravity center of grain loss gradually moved northward. Accordingly, this paper proposes that our government should adopt different precautionary measures in different regions of China: measures against drought and hail in Northwest China; measures against drought and waterlogging in Northeast China; measures against flood and low temperature in Central China; measures against waterlogging and typhoon in coastal areas of Southeast China. And our government should show more concern to and formulate feasible protection plans for hostile- environment Northwest China and highgrain- production Northeast China so that a good harvest in grains could be guaranteed.", "abstract_ch": "中国是一个自然灾害频发的国家,研究其自然灾害演变特征及粮食灾损规律,对实现中国社会经济可持续发展、解决中国粮食安全问题具有重要意义。本文先基于Python语言编程获取1949-2015年中国31省市自然灾害造成的受灾、成灾、绝收面积,构建灾害强度指数分析不同灾种的时序特征分异,利用趋势分析、ESDA方法分析不同灾种在省域空间的分布特征及冷热区;再获取1949-2015年粮食种植数据,通过粮食灾损估算模型、定义粮食灾损率、地理空间探测器,计算并检验中国粮食损失时空特征及分异性。结果表明:①相比受灾面积曲线,本文构建的灾害程度指数能够更好揭示自然灾害时序演变特征;② 1949-2015年期间中国两大主力灾害(洪灾、旱灾)交替出现,未来5~10年以洪灾为主;③灾种排序旱灾>洪灾>风雹>低温>台风,其中旱灾、洪灾受灾占比过半;④省域不同灾种间空间趋势变化特征明显,区域受灾面积东部>西部,北部>南部,且北部灾种单一、南部多灾并发;⑤自然灾害受灾总和、旱灾、雹灾、低温空间上全局自相关性不显著,呈随机模式分布,洪涝、台风在空间分布上具有显著的全局自相关性,呈集聚模式;⑥ 1949-2015年灾害、灾损量、灾损率整体时序趋势呈现先升后降,2000年为临界点,空间分布具有异质性,单因子解释力度差异显著,多因子交互均呈非线性增强关系,胡焕庸线两侧冷热点分布呈两极化且其重心向北迁移。建议政府加强除旱减雹(西北)、除旱排内涝(东北)、排涝防冻(中部)、排涝预台(东南沿海)等工程技术措施;同时西北(环境恶劣)、东北(中国粮仓)应作为防灾减灾重点保护区,制定专项保护方案,以保证中国粮食丰产增收。", "keywords_en": "ESDA; natural disaster; disaster intensity index; ESDA; grain disaster losses; q- statistic; China", "keywords_ch": "自然灾害; 灾害强度指数; 粮食灾损; q统计量; 中国", "address_en": "Zhao Yinghui,College of Resources and Environment, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150030, China.Guo Jingpeng,College of Resources and Environment, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150030, China.Xiang Yanan,College of Resources and Environment, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150030, China.Mao Kebiao,Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.Han Jiaqi,Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.Li Yihan,School of Land Science and Technology, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), Beijing 100081, China.Wu Nei,School of Resource, Environment and Safety Engineering, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan, Hunan 411100, China.", "address_ch": "赵映慧,东北农业大学资源环境学院, 哈尔滨, 黑龙江 150030, 中国.郭晶鹏,东北农业大学资源环境学院, 哈尔滨, 黑龙江 150030, 中国.项亚楠,东北农业大学资源环境学院, 哈尔滨, 黑龙江 150030, 中国.毛克彪,中国农业科学院农业资源与农业区划研究所, 北京 100081, 中国.韩家琪,中国农业科学院农业资源与农业区划研究所, 北京 100081, 中国.李怡函,(北京)中国地质大学土地科学技术学院, 北京 100081, 中国.吴馁,湖南科技大学资源环境与安全工程学院, 湘潭, 湖南 411100, 中国.", "research_areas": "Agriculture", "wos_categories": ""}

The main findings are as follows: (1) In general, the average concentration of PM_(2.5) in China has increased quickly and reached its peak value in the year of 2006; after that, it has been maintained at around 22.47- 28.26 mug/m~3. (2) PM_(2.5) is strikingly uneven in China, with a higher concentration in North and East than in South and West, respectively. In particular, the areas with a relatively high concentration of PM_(2.5) are mainly the four regions including the Huang- Huai- Hai Plain, the Lower Yangtze River Delta Plain, the Sichuan Basin, and the Taklimakan Desert. Among them, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region has the highest concentration of PM_(2.5). (3) The center of gravity of PM_(2.5) has shown an overall eastward movement trend, which indicates an increasingly serious haze in eastern China. Particularly, the center of gravity of high-value PM_(2.5) is kept on moving eastward, while that of the low-value PM_(2.5) moves westward. (4) The spatial autocorrelation analysis indicates a significantly positive spatial correlation. The \"High- High\" PM_(2.5) agglomeration areas include the Huang- Huai- Hai Plain, Fenhe-Weihe River Basin, Sichuan Basin, and Jianghan plain regions. The \"Low-Low\" PM_(2.5) agglomeration areas include Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang to the north of the Great Wall, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and Taiwan, Hainan and Fujian and other southeast coastal and island areas. (5) Geographic detection analysis indicates that both natural and human factors account for the spatial variations of PM_(2.5) concentration.

Based on the large amount of real time data of the Internet, we constructed a spatio-temporal data mining method using long time series. Firstly, a large number of real estate listing information and transaction data existing in different real estate business website had been obtained by web crawler technology. Secondly, the correlation between housing listing price and transaction price was tested using a linear regression model and the usability of ubiquitous online real estate data had been validated. Thirdly, a multi-scale grid model of mixed pixels was proposed, which was based on the description of the statistical characteristics of the real estate, and the problem of multi-source data fusion was solved. Moran's I and Geo-detector were used to analyze the geographic spatial autocorrelation and non-homogeneity of housing listing price. The spatial raster database of long term real estate was constructed based on the combination of adjacent spatio-temporal interpolation and P-Bshade interpolation. Finally, the inner part of Beijing Six Ring Road was selected as the study area. We analyzed the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of second-hand housing prices by grid partition algorithm. Overall, we explored the real time dynamic analysis method of real estate. The results showed that: in the first half of 2016, the growth rate of second-hand housing price was larger, and the latter half of the growth was relatively flat. The spatial distribution of second-hand housing price in Beijing was dominated by a single center pattern. At the same time, there are distributions of high island area. Dongcheng and Xicheng district were the core area of high housing prices, and the magnitude of price volatility was not consistent in different direction. The descending velocity of south of central city was the fastest. The diminishing rate of the north and northwest of central city were the slowest.

By means of Python Programming Language and on the basis of grain production loss over Chinese 31 provinces from 1949 to 2015, this paper first constructed disaster intensity index to analyze temporal features of different natural disasters, and with trend analysis as well as ESDA to analyze spatial characteristics in different provinces. Then the paper collected crop planting data to calculate and test the spatio-temporal characteristics in grain loss through estimation model on grain loss, defining grain loss rate and geodetector. The conclusions of paper are: (1)compared with the curve of disaster- affected areas, disaster intensity index constructed in this paper could better present temporal changes of natural disasters; (2)China alternately suffered from flood and drought between 1949 and 2015 and in the coming 5 to 10 years the main suffering would be flood; (3)the ranking of natural disasters is: drought>flood>low temperature >hail>typhoon, among which, the areas affected by drought and flood occupied more than half of the total; (4)natural disasters show clear spatial characteristics and the ranking of regional areas prone to disasters is: eastern region>western region; northern region >southern region. Generally speaking, northern region is prone to only one particular natural disaster while southern region tends to suffer from several natural disasters in the meantime; (5)the sum of natural disasters, drought, hail and low temperature, with their random distribution in space, presented unclear spatial autocorrelation, while flood and typhoon, with their clustering model in space distribution, showed clear spatial autocorrelation; (6)from 1949 to 2015, the general temporal changes of disasters, grain loss amount and loss rate showed a feature that the figures would rise first, and then dropped with the critical point in 2000. Meanwhile, they had significant heterogeneity in spatial distribution, great difference in single- factor explanation power, and multi- factor interaction showed a nonlinear enhancement relation. The distribution of hot and cold spots on both sides of the Hu Line presented a polarization pattern and the gravity center of grain loss gradually moved northward. Accordingly, this paper proposes that our government should adopt different precautionary measures in different regions of China: measures against drought and hail in Northwest China; measures against drought and waterlogging in Northeast China; measures against flood and low temperature in Central China; measures against waterlogging and typhoon in coastal areas of Southeast China. And our government should show more concern to and formulate feasible protection plans for hostile- environment Northwest China and highgrain- production Northeast China so that a good harvest in grains could be guaranteed.", "abstract_ch": "中国是一个自然灾害频发的国家,研究其自然灾害演变特征及粮食灾损规律,对实现中国社会经济可持续发展、解决中国粮食安全问题具有重要意义。本文先基于Python语言编程获取1949-2015年中国31省市自然灾害造成的受灾、成灾、绝收面积,构建灾害强度指数分析不同灾种的时序特征分异,利用趋势分析、ESDA方法分析不同灾种在省域空间的分布特征及冷热区;再获取1949-2015年粮食种植数据,通过粮食灾损估算模型、定义粮食灾损率、地理空间探测器,计算并检验中国粮食损失时空特征及分异性。结果表明:①相比受灾面积曲线,本文构建的灾害程度指数能够更好揭示自然灾害时序演变特征;② 1949-2015年期间中国两大主力灾害(洪灾、旱灾)交替出现,未来5~10年以洪灾为主;③灾种排序旱灾>洪灾>风雹>低温>台风,其中旱灾、洪灾受灾占比过半;④省域不同灾种间空间趋势变化特征明显,区域受灾面积东部>西部,北部>南部,且北部灾种单一、南部多灾并发;⑤自然灾害受灾总和、旱灾、雹灾、低温空间上全局自相关性不显著,呈随机模式分布,洪涝、台风在空间分布上具有显著的全局自相关性,呈集聚模式;⑥ 1949-2015年灾害、灾损量、灾损率整体时序趋势呈现先升后降,2000年为临界点,空间分布具有异质性,单因子解释力度差异显著,多因子交互均呈非线性增强关系,胡焕庸线两侧冷热点分布呈两极化且其重心向北迁移。建议政府加强除旱减雹(西北)、除旱排内涝(东北)、排涝防冻(中部)、排涝预台(东南沿海)等工程技术措施;同时西北(环境恶劣)、东北(中国粮仓)应作为防灾减灾重点保护区,制定专项保护方案,以保证中国粮食丰产增收。", "keywords_en": "ESDA; natural disaster; disaster intensity index; ESDA; grain disaster losses; q- statistic; China", "keywords_ch": "自然灾害; 灾害强度指数; 粮食灾损; q统计量; 中国", "address_en": "Zhao Yinghui,College of Resources and Environment, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150030, China.Guo Jingpeng,College of Resources and Environment, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150030, China.Xiang Yanan,College of Resources and Environment, Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150030, China.Mao Kebiao,Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.Han Jiaqi,Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing 100081, China.Li Yihan,School of Land Science and Technology, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), Beijing 100081, China.Wu Nei,School of Resource, Environment and Safety Engineering, Hunan University of Science and Technology, Xiangtan, Hunan 411100, China.", "address_ch": "赵映慧,东北农业大学资源环境学院, 哈尔滨, 黑龙江 150030, 中国.郭晶鹏,东北农业大学资源环境学院, 哈尔滨, 黑龙江 150030, 中国.项亚楠,东北农业大学资源环境学院, 哈尔滨, 黑龙江 150030, 中国.毛克彪,中国农业科学院农业资源与农业区划研究所, 北京 100081, 中国.韩家琪,中国农业科学院农业资源与农业区划研究所, 北京 100081, 中国.李怡函,(北京)中国地质大学土地科学技术学院, 北京 100081, 中国.吴馁,湖南科技大学资源环境与安全工程学院, 湘潭, 湖南 411100, 中国.", "research_areas": "Agriculture", "wos_categories": ""}
