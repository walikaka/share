Stratified ordinary kriging (SOK), which considers the sharp spatial variability of SOC due to natural factors and human activities, is a feasible way to map SOC with high spatial heterogeneity. However, conventional stratified methods are arbitrary and may therefore result in unnecessary and ineffective stratification. In addition, SOK performs poorly when soil properties of some strata present a local trend. In this study, we propose a geographical detector-based stratified regression kriging (GD-SRK) strategy, which aims to guide the stratification, gain strata-dependent knowledges, and improve the performance of stratified kriging. The study area locates in Jianghan Plain, China. The soil and land use types are used as categorical variables, while land use percentages are used as continuous variables. Ordinary kriging (OK), regression kriging (RK), and geographical detector-based stratified ordinary kriging are used as references of GD-SRK. Results indicated that the spatial heterogeneity of SOC was attributed to the differences in soil types and land use types and suggested that the study area should be stratified into four. The spillover effect of land use on the SOC content depended on the strata. Specifically, the SOC in strata II (paddy fields n Fluvisols) and IV (irrigated lands n Fluvisols) was unaffected by land use percentages and was estimated via OK. The SOC in strata I (paddy fields n Anthrosols and Luvisols) and III (irrigated lands n Anthrosols and Luvisols) was negatively correlated with the percentage of irrigated lands. Thus, their estimation of SOC via RK was possible. Using these knowledges, the GD-SRK outperformed the other methods by obtaining highest prediction accuracy and R-2.

The China government has been very strict in arable land protection, and a package of policies and measures have been promulgated.

However, above stated policies are all designed from the perspective of space control with the purpose of reducing arable land loss or increasing arable land area, few policies have been designed from the perspective of utilization control, namely guide the actual arable land farming in sustainable ways and constraint unreasonable land use behavior such as overuse, rough use, land abandonment. In this paper, we analyze spatial distribution of average land-use intensity (ALUI) at the county-level in Mainland China, which can be used as a significant index for evaluating the rationality of arable land use and providing effective decision-making supporting information for design of regional arable land protection policy. Based on the experimental results, there is still considerable room for yield improvement as the ALUI of similar to 73.1 % counties are lower than 0.7 while the 53.60 % counties are lower than 0.6. Furthermore, the ALUI dataset shows significant global spatial autocorrelation characteristic. Boundaries of regions that aggregated by counties with high ALUI are more consistent with that of provincial administrative districts, comparing with that of substandard farming system regions. On the other hand, counties with low ALUI are mostly cluster in mountains, hills, or plateaus, where grain yield is mainly limited by regional hydrothermal conditions. In addition, counties with different ALUI status have been divided into six classes, using k-means clustering algorithm.

The causes of urban shrinkage include agglomeration effects of central cities, aging of demographic structure, supply-demand mismatch between industries and market, weak connection between industries and services, and underdeveloped public services. Furthermore, the agglomeration effects of central cities play a critical role in urban shrinkage in northeast China.

Because of drought conditions and fragile ecology, these regions cannot develop agriculture at the expense of the environment. Given the challenges of global warming, the green total factor productivity (GTFP), taking CO(2)emissions as an undesirable output, is an effective index for measuring the sustainability of agricultural development. Agricultural GTFP can be influenced by both internal production factors (labor force, machinery, land, agricultural plastic film, diesel, pesticide, and fertilizer) and external climate factors (temperature, precipitation, and sunshine duration). In this study, we used the Super-slacks-based measure (Super-SBM) model to measure agricultural GTFP during the period 2000-2016 at the regional level. Our results show that the average agricultural GTFP of most provinces and autonomous regions in arid and semi-arid regions underwent a fluctuating increase during the study period (2000-2016), and the fluctuation was caused by the production factors (input and output factors). To improve agricultural GTFP, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Gansu should reduce agricultural labor force input; Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Shanxi should decrease machinery input; Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Shanxi should reduce fertilizer input; Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Gansu, and Ningxia should reduce diesel input; Xinjiang and Gansu should decrease plastic film input; and Gansu, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia should cut pesticide input. Desirable output agricultural earnings should be increased in Qinghai and Tibet, and undesirable output (CO(2)emissions) should be reduced in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu, and Shaanxi. Agricultural GTFP is influenced not only by internal production factors but also by external climate factors. To determine the influence of climate factors on GTFP in these provinces and autonomous regions, we used a Geographical Detector (Geodetector) model to analyze the influence of climate factors (temperature, precipitation, and sunshine duration) and identify the relationships between different climate factors and GTFP. We found that temperature played a significant role in the spatial heterogeneity of GTFP among provinces and autonomous regions in arid and semi-arid regions. For Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet, a suitable average annual temperature would be in the range of 7 degrees C-9 degrees C; for Gansu, Shanxi, and Ningxia, it would be 11 degrees C-13 degrees C; and for Shaanxi, it would be 15 degrees C-17 degrees C. Stable climatic conditions and more efficient production are prerequisites for the development of sustainable agriculture. Hence, in the agricultural production process, reducing the redundancy of input factors is the best way to reduce CO(2)emissions and to maintain temperatures, thereby improving the agricultural GTFP.The significance of this study is that it explores the impact of both internal production factors and external climatic factors on the development of sustainable agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions, identifying an effective way forward for the arid and semi-arid regions of Northwest China.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "climate change;agricultural GTFP;Super-slacks-based measure (Super-SBM) model;Geodetector;CO(2)emissions;arid regions;semi-arid regions;WATER-USE EFFICIENCY;RAINFALL HARVESTING SYSTEM;RIDGE-FURROW;CARBON EMISSIONS;PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH;ENERGY-CONSUMPTION;CROP PRODUCTIVITY;LOESS PLATEAU;GRAIN-YIELD;LAND-USE", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Ocean Univ China, Sch Econ, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Ocean Univ China, Inst Marine Dev, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Ocean Univ China, Sch Foreign Languages, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China\n[ 4 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China\n[ 5 ]‎ Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Environmental Sciences & Ecology", "wos_categories": "Environmental Sciences"}

Firstly, monitoring data of monthly rainfall, variations of reservoir water level, deformation of landslide surface and piles' head were preprocessed.

The comparison with improved Apriori algorithm shows that the presented framework can intuitively measure influence degrees of each factor and analyze interaction types of any two factors.

Meanwhile, 9 driving factors related to natural conditions and socioeconomic conditions of average slope, average elevation, the city location, the city size, high-speed railways, highways, gross domestic product (GDP) density, nonagricultural population, and population density of 2000 and 2010 at the municipal level are constructed.

Despite their different moving directions, the distance between the two centroids is decreasing, indicating both significant regional differences of the HEP in China and a narrowing gap between the HEP and the total population in recent years. The results of the factor detector of 2000 and 2010 suggest that the proportion of the nonagricultural population and the city location are the main driving factors of the distribution of the HEP, with driving forces between 0.494 and 0.627, followed by the city size, highways, and GDP density, with driving forces are between 0.199 and 0.302. It indicates that urbanization levels and urban locations are the main factors affecting the spatial distribution of the HEP. The results of the interaction detection reveal that the interaction of the nonagricultural population and the GDP density can explain 92.7% of the spatial variety of the HEP in 2000, while that of the nonagricultural population and the population density can explain 97.6% of the spatial variety of the HEP in 2010, which reflects a more balanced development of the HEP.

In order to provide a deep insight into the complex driving mechanism of urban expansion, this study began with an analysis of the spatio-temporal characteristics of urban expansion in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) urban agglomeration in different periods. Then, the driving mechanism of urban expansion intensity (UEI) and urban expansion landscape pattern were analyzed, based on the interaction of different driving factors over space and time.

From 2000 to 2015, the most important source of urban land expansion was farmland, followed by forest land. Meanwhile, the decline in the proportion of outlying expansion type indicated that the urban land has gradually become more compact.

Digital geomorphic mapping (DGM) approaches that can simplify and translate the inclusion of \"human knowledge\" to automatic terrain classification across a broader spectrum of terrain morphological units as well as a range of spatial scales, therefore, offer great potential for improved topographic and landscape analysis. One such approach is the mapping of landform elements using the concept of the Geomorphon (geomorphological phonotypes). The output of the geomorphon approach is the stratification of the landscape into ten unique but recognisable landform elements: peak, ridge, shoulder, spur, and slope, hollow, foot slope, valley, depression and flat. Equally appealing is the way the model self-adapts to local topography using a line-of-sight principle enabling better matching of landform elements to computational spatial scale. The purpose of this paper is to observe the effects that different pixel resolution (grain size) and digital elevation model source (DEM) would have on the replication of observed geomorphic spatial patterns and representation of terrain selected parameters within the landscape. This paper provides a comprehensive exploratory assessment of digital terrain representation and relief classification using an automated geomorphometric mapping approach, by evaluating three different digital surface models (SUDEM, SRTM, ASTER GDEM2) and different spatial resolution (30 m & 90 m) for an 11,200 ha catchment in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. To test the self-adapting ability of the geomorphon approach under regional conditions, we use 4750 gridded terrain samples to quantitatively analyse how the choice of terrain model and scale influence the extraction, generalisation and representation of digitally-derived terrain attributes such as slope, elevation and terrain unit feature extent. We further show how the variation in resulting terrain unit representation is limited by spatial resolution discontinuities of selected elementary soil association distribution, soil texture and soil depth. We also introduce the results of a Similarity Index used to gauge the degree of recall and precision between the different geomorphic landscape features. Finally, the findings of the regional geomorphon-soil relationships are presented in a readily interpretable and qualitative manner, providing a \"quasi-landscape signature\" for potential localised geomorphons. The application of the study findings may be beneficial to practitioners looking to align or refine modelled terrain classification approaches with expert perception and formalised heuristic approaches.

Results and discussions The results suggest that vegetation coverage explains 7.28% of soil erosion distribution, and the impact of vegetation coverage on soil erosion is significantly larger than that of the other five driving factors (p < 0.05). In recent years, the explanatory power of vegetation coverage to soil erosion has experienced a change from increasing to decreasing trend. The interaction between vegetation coverage and slope explains up to 32.69% of soil erosion distribution, and an increasing trend has been detected in the explanatory power of this interaction. The spatial heterogeneity of soil erosion can be well understood by vegetation coverage and elevation. The high-risk areas are featured by elevation ranging from 1135 to 1777 m or vegetation coverage between 50 and 62%. Changes in vegetation coverage and its spatial distribution at different elevations are the main causes of the variations in the explanatory power. Conclusions The spatial analysis and quantitative analysis of six driving factors in soil erosion have improved the understanding of the heterogeneity in soil erosion. Measures in soil and water conservation should be strengthened in high-risk areas. The interaction between vegetation coverage and slope is the dominating contributor to soil erosion. The study provides a scientific basis for rational prevention of soil erosion in the Qiantang River catchment.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Qiantang River catchment;RUSLE;Soil erosion;Geographic detectors;Driving factors;LAND-USE;PATTERNS", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Proc, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Agriculture", "wos_categories": "Environmental Sciences; Soil Science"}

This study uses the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi), a typical area with a high background Cd level and Cd pollution related to mining activities, as an example to explore the source and predict areas with high Cd risk in soils based on the geographical detector method. The areas with high Cd in Guangxi soils were classified into non-mining areas and mining areas according to their potential Cd sources. The results show that the rich Cd content in the soils from the non-mining area of Guangxi was mainly derived from the soil type (q = 0.34), geological age (q = 0.27), rock type (q = 0.26) and geomorphic type (q = 0.20). Specifically, the Cd content was derived from the weathering and deposition processes of carbonatite from the Carboniferous system in the karst area. The high Cd content in the soils of the mining area of Guangxi was mainly derived from the area mined for mineral resources (q = 0.08) and rock type (q = 0.05). Specifically, the Cd content was derived from the mining of lead-zinc ores. The areas in Guangxi with a high risk of Cd soil pollution are mostly concentrated in karst areas, such as Hechi, Laibin, Chongzuo, southern Liuzhou and Baise, northern Nanning city and northeastern Guilin city, and some mining areas. These results indicated that the high Cd concentration in the soils of large areas of Guangxi is probably due to natural sources, while the high Cd concentration around mining areas is due to anthropogenic sources.

Although the major sources of acid deposition have been clarified previously, the contributions of socioeconomic (natural) factors to the regional acid deposition remained unknown. Therefore, a series of valuable data including socioeconomic (natural) variables and measured pH value in the rainwater at the city level were collected to identify the key factors influencing the rainwater pH value at the national and the regional scale using the spatial econometric model/geographical detector technique and geographical weight regression (GWR) model, respectively. The results showed that the annual mean pH value in the rainwater in China was 6.54 +/- 0.72. The rainwater pH in winter (6.01 +/- 0.41) was significantly lower than those observed during summer (6.74 +/- 0.64), spring (6.71 +/- 0.71) and autumn (6.71 +/- 0.69). The spatial econometric model indicated that socioeconomic indicators including per capita gross industrial production (GIP), ratio of built-up area to the urban land (RBU), foreign direct investment (FDI), SO2 emission, and meteorological factors of annual mean precipitation (AMP), and annual mean relative humidity (AMRH) were the main factors for the acid deposition. The geographical detector technique implied that the power of determinants were in the order of AMRH (10.00%) = AMP (10.00%) > SO2 emission (8.51%) > FDI (8.32%) > RBU (7.64%) > per capita GIP (7.00%). The GWR implied that GIP, FDI, and SO2 emission made relatively higher contribution to acid deposition in East China relative to other regions owning to the huge population and the higher energy consumption. The higher rainfall amount and RH in Southeast China significantly increased the pollutant deposition fluxes and promoted the heterogeneous transformations of precursors of acid rain, respectively.

The generations of the epidemic spread are not well known, yet these are critical parameters to facilitate an understanding of the epidemic. A seafood wholesale market and Wuhan city, China, were recognized as the primary and secondary epidemic sources. Human movements nationwide from the two epidemic sources revealed the characteristics of the first-generation and second-generation spreads of the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the potential third-generation spread.Methods: We used spatiotemporal data of COVID-19 cases in mainland China and two categories of location-based service (LBS) data of mobile devices from the primary and secondary epidemic sources to calculate Pearson correlation coefficient,r, and spatial stratified heterogeneity, q, statistics.Results: Two categories of device trajectories had generally significant correlations and determinant powers of the epidemic spread. Bothr and q statistics decreased with distance from the epidemic sources and their associations changed with time. At the beginning of the epidemic, the mixed first-generation and second-generation spreads appeared in most cities with confirmed cases. They strongly interacted to enhance the epidemic in Hubei province and the trend was also significant in the provinces adjacent to Hubei. The third-generation spread started in Wuhan from January 17-20, 2020, and in Hubei from January 23-24. No obvious third-generation spread was detected outside Hubei.Conclusions: The findings provide important foundations to quantify the effect of human movement on epidemic spread and inform ongoing control strategies. The spatiotemporal association between the epidemic spread and human movements from the primary and secondary epidemic sources indicates a transfer from second to third generations of the infection. Urgent control measures include preventing the potential third-generation spread in mainland China, eliminating it in Hubei, and reducing the interaction influence of first-generation and second-generation spreads.

However, the disparity between urban and rural areas in the risk of preterm birth (PTB) has yet to be elucidated. Considering geographic contexts as homogeneous or ignoring urban-rural differences cannot accurately reveal the disparities in the health effects of air pollution under different geographic contexts. The aims of this study were to examine the disparities in the risks of PTB in three different regions and five urban-rural types and to investigate the extent to which fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure during the entire pregnancy can explain the variations. Methods We collected data on 429,865 singleton newborns born in 2014 in Hubei Province, China, and divided Hubei Province into three regions. Spatial correlation methods were employed to measure the associations between the rate of PTB and air pollution using average annual indexes for the entire province and regions. A series of multilevel logistic models were conducted to examine disparities in the risks of PTB with decreases in urbanity and the effects of air pollution exposure on the occurrence of preterm births. Results The PM(2.5)concentration was significantly different across the regions. The eastern region had the most wide-ranged and serious level of pollution, whereas the levels in the middle and western regions weakened. The odds of PTB and air pollution exhibited a positive spatial correlation for the entire province and in the east (BiMoran's I = 0.106 and 0.697, respectively). Significant urban-rural disparities in the risks of PTB were noted in the east and middle regions, and the mean PM(2.5)exposure during the entire pregnancy was positively associated with PTB risk. However, in the west, the results showed weak differences in the risks of PTB among the five urban-rural types and an insignificant effect of PM(2.5)exposure. The direction of the effect of district/county-level income on PTB varied by region. Conclusions This study finds that air pollution exposure and PTB have significant and positive spatial relationships in areas with a serious air pollution burden. The risks of PTB in three regions of Hubei Province follow the same W-shaped pattern as urbanity decreases and rurality increases. High levels of air pollution exposure may be an important disadvantage for urban pregnant women in this setting.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Air pollution exposure;Preterm birth;Urban-rural disparity;Spatial correlation;Multilevel logistic model;FINE PARTICULATE MATTER;CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE;MATERNAL EXPOSURE;PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY;NITROGEN-DIOXIDE;CHILD HEALTH;CANCER-RISK;NEW-YORK;ASSOCIATION;WEIGHT", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing Key Lab Remote Sensing Environm & Digital, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Tongji Hosp, Wuhan 430030, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health", "wos_categories": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"}

The matching odds ratio (OR) index proposed in this paper was applied to measure the matching levels between the two terms in each provincial area.ResultsThe Chinese spatial and temporal matching q-statistic values between the PAR and three vital types of NMRTR were all less than 0.45.

To solve this problem, this study performed a spatially statistical exploration by using multiple models. Taking the Yili region as the case-study area, the field soil survey, remote sensing inversion and modified Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation were used to estimate the soil erosion in 1990 and 2015. Then, a spatial analysis model was used to quantify the relative importance of multiple indicators and mutual interactions in the soil erosion. The spatial distribution of soil erosion was shown to be basically related to topography with the largest importance in Yili region. Importance of land use, rainfall, and soil changes along with the rugged topography influencing the soil erosion evolution decreased successively. The largest interacted impact was found in the topography with a non-linear enhancement with vegetation factor. The decrease in soil erosion cannot be explained by the increase in rainfall erosivity, but it is likely to the result of land-use changes, reflected in the improvement of the vegetation cover and management factor and erosion control practice factor within the sloping areas. Examining the spatial consistency and intersection of triggering factors, it implied that reasonably reclaiming the desert grassland with the soil improvement and biomass accumulation would mitigate the soil erosion in the Yili region.

Spatial pattern characteristics and identification of factors that influence water yield are the basis for decision making. However, there are limited studies on the driving mechanisms that affect the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem services. In this study, we used the Hengduan Mountain region in southwest China, with obvious spatial heterogeneity, as the research site. The water yield module in the InVEST software was used to simulate the spatial distribution of water yield. Also, quantitative attribution analysis was conducted for various geomorphological and climatic zones in the Hengduan Mountain region by using the geographical detector method. Influencing factors, such as climate, topography, soil, vegetation type, and land use type and pattern, were taken into consideration for this analysis. Four key findings were obtained. First, water yield spatial heterogeneity is influenced most by climate-related factors, where precipitation and evapotranspiration are the dominant factors. Second, the relative importance of each impact factor to the water yield heterogeneity differs significantly by geomorphological and climatic zones. In flat areas, the influence of evapotranspiration is higher than that of precipitation. As relief increases, the importance of precipitation increases and eventually, it becomes the most influential factor. Evapotranspiration is the most influential factor in a plateau climate zone, while in the mid-subtropical zone, precipitation is the main controlling factor. Third, land use type is also an important driving force in flat areas. Thus, more attention should be paid to urbanization and land use planning, which involves land use changes, to mitigate the impact on water yield spatial pattern. The fourth finding was that a risk detector showed that Primarosol and Anthropogenic soil areas, shrub areas, and areas with slope <5 degrees and 25 degrees-35 degrees should be recognized as water yield important zones, while the corresponding elevation values are different among different geomorphological and climatic zones.

The geographically and temporally weighted regression model was first applied to determine the spatiotemporal effect of the morphological metrics on vibrancy, and then, the geographical detector was employed from the perspective of spatially stratified heterogeneity to reveal the synergetic impacts. The following findings were revealed. (1) Dense street networks, small and medium-sized blocks, and the diversification and intensification of building and land use are beneficial to urban vibrancy. (2) Under the premise of adapting to local conditions, urban spaces combine multiple morphological metrics for the accomplishment of a full-region and all-time vibrancy.

They are inextricably linked to socio-economic development. Deaths caused by NCDs should be different in different socio-economic development stages. The stratified heterogeneity of NCD deaths is currently not fully explored. Methods Countries were classified according to their socio-economic types and development stages, which were illustrated as a tree-like structure called Geotree. NCD deaths were linked to the countries and so were attached to the Geotree, which was modelled by a multilevel model (MLM) approach. Accordingly, the levels of NCD death indexes were predicted for 2030. Results Through the Geotree structure constructed in the study, it can be seen that the NCD death index has obvious stratified heterogeneity; that is, the NCD death index shows different trends in different country types and socio-economic development stages. In the first-level branches (country type), as national income increases, NCD mortality rate decreases and the proportion of NCD deaths to total deaths increases. In the secondary-level trunks (socio-economic development stage), as a country's development stage rises, the NCD mortality rate decreases and the proportion of NCD deaths to total deaths increases. In addition, combined with the hierarchical nature of the evolution tree model, the MLM was used to predict the global NCD death index for 2030. The result was that by 2030, the global average age-standardized NCD mortality rate would be 510.54 (per 100,000 population) and the global average mortality for NCD deaths of the total number of deaths would be 75.26%. Conclusions This study found that there is a significant association between socio-economic factors and NCD death indicators in the tree-like structure. In the Geotree, countries on the same branch or trunk can learn from countries with higher development stages to formulate more effective NCD response policies and find the right prevention and treatment path.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Non-communicable diseases;Geotree;Socio-economic factors;Prediction;CARDIOVASCULAR RISK-FACTORS;SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS;MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS;DIETARY-FAT;TOBACCO USE;LOW-INCOME;COUNTRIES;URBANIZATION;EPIDEMIOLOGY;INEQUALITIES", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health", "wos_categories": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"}

Evidence of the quantitative effects of determinants on MMR in China is limited. A better understanding of the spatiotemporal heterogeneity and quantifying determinants of the MMR would support evidence-based policymaking to sustainably reduce the MMR in China and other developing areas worldwide.Methods and findingsWe used data on MMR collected by the National Maternal and Child Health Surveillance System (NMCHSS) at the county level in China from 2010 to 2013. We employed a Bayesian space-time model to investigate the spatiotemporal trends in the MMR from 2010 to 2013. We used Bayesian multivariable regression and GeoDetector models to address 3 main ecological determinants of the MMR, including per capita income (PCI), the proportion of pregnant women who delivered in hospitals (PPWDH), and the proportion of pregnant women who had at least 5 check-ups (PPWFC). Among the 2,205 counties, there were 925 (42.0%) hotspot counties, located mostly in China's western and southwestern regions, with a higher MMR, and 764 (34.6%) coldspot counties with a lower MMR than the national level. China's westernmost regions, including Tibet and western Xinjiang, experienced a weak downward trend over the study period. Nationwide, medical intervention was the major determinant of the change in MMR. The MMR decreased by 1.787 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.424-2.142, p < 0.001) per 100,000 live births when PPWDH increased by 1% and decreased by 0.623 (95% CI 0.436-0.798, p < 0.001) per 100,000 live births when PPWFC increased by 1%. The major determinants for the MMR in China's western and southwestern regions were PCI and PPWFC, while that in China's eastern and southern coastlands was PCI. The MMR in western and southwestern regions decreased nonsignificantly by 1.111 (95% CI - 1.485-3.655, p = 0.20) per 100,000 live births when PCI in these regions increased by 1,000 Chinese Yuan and decreased by 1.686 (95% CI 1.275-2.090, p < 0.001) when PPWFC increased by 1%. Additionally, the western and southwestern regions showed the strongest interactive effects between different factors, in which the corresponding explanatory power of any 2 interacting factors reached up to greater than 80.0% (p < 0.001) for the MMR. Limitations of this study include a relatively short study period and lack of full coverage of eastern coastlands with especially low MMR.ConclusionsAlthough China has accomplished a 75% reduction in the MMR, spatial heterogeneity still exists. In this study, we have identified 925 (hotspot) high-risk counties, mostly located in western and southwestern regions, and among which 332 counties are experiencing a slower pace of decrease than the national downward trend. Nationally, medical intervention is the major determinant. The major determinants for the MMR in western and southwestern regions, which are developing areas, are PCI and PPWFC, while that in China's developed areas is PCI. The interactive influence of any two of the three factors, PCI, PPWDH, and PPWFC, in western and southwestern regions was up to and in excess of 80% (p < 0.001).", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "ZERO-INFLATED POISSON;RISK;BANGLADESH;COUNTDOWN;DISEASE;HEALTH;DEATH", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Shanxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat, Taiyuan, Shanxi, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Sichuan Univ, West China Univ Hosp 2, Dept Obstet, Natl Off Maternal & Child Hlth Surveillance China, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China\n[ 4 ]‎ Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China\n[ 5 ]‎ Monash Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, Melbourne, Vic, Australia", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "General & Internal Medicine", "wos_categories": "Medicine, General & Internal"}

However, wetland cover types have changed dynamically and have attracted the attention of society and researchers over the past few decades. To obtain detailed knowledge and understanding of the long-term landcover dynamics of Poyang Lake and the associated driving forces, Landsat and HJ-1A/B images (31 images) were used to acquire classification and frequency maps of Poyang Lake in the dry season from 1973-2019 based on the random forest (RF) algorithm. In addition, the driving forces were discussed according to the Geodetector model. The results showed that the coverage of water and mudflat showed opposite trends from 1987-2019. Water and vegetation exhibited a significant decreasing trend from 1981-2003 and from 1996-2004 (p < 0.01), respectively. A phenomenon of vegetation expanding from west to east was found, and the expansion areas were mainly concentrated in the central zone of Poyang Lake, while vegetation in the northern mountainous area of Songmen (region 1) and eastern Songmen Mountain (region 2), showed a significantly expanded trend (R-2 > 0.6, p < 0.01) during the five-decade period. The year-long dominant distribution of water occurred mainly in the two deltas formed by the Raohe and Tongjin rivers and the Fuhe and Xinjiang rivers, with deep water.

Due to the location, natural resources endowment, and traffic accessibility, the urbanization speed is relatively slow in border areas. Therefore, it is a special area that needs to pay close attention to, especially under the background of the Belt and Road Initiative and China's regional coordinated development program. Based on the county-level data from 2000 to 2015, this paper tries to analyze the spatio-temporal pattern of urbanization in 134 border counties, and applies geographical detector method to study the driving forces of urbanization in border areas. Conclusions are as follows: (1) From 2000 to 2015, urbanization rate in border areas has been lower than the national average, and the gap has been widening. Some border counties in southern Xinjiang, Tibet, northeast of Inner Mongolia, and Yunnan, are even facing the problem of population loss. (2) In the same period, urbanization rate in the northwestern and southwestern border is low, while their urbanization rate grows relatively faster comparing with other border counties; urbanization rate in Tibet border is the lowest and grows relatively slowly; urbanization rate in the northeastern and northern border is slightly higher, but it grows slowly or even stagnates. (3) Transportation and industry are the important driving forces of urbanization in border areas, while the driving forces of market is relatively weak. And there are obvious mutual reinforcements among the driving forces, while the effort and explanatory power of resource force increases obviously after interaction. (4) Urbanization rate in the northwestern and southwestern border areas grows relatively fast, with industrial force and transportation force, market force and administrative force as the main driving forces respectively. Tibet border area has the lowest urbanization rate and growth rate, as the driving force of urbanization with strong contribution has not yet formed in Tibet.

In addition, it has become the focus of worldwide concern whether and how institutional quality affects haze pollution. In this study, we explored the impacts of political corruption on haze pollution in 139 global countries. We employed a geographical detector model to identify the driving factors of spatial differentiation in global haze pollution. In addition, corruption degree and per capita gross domestic production (GDP) were used as threshold variables to analyze whether there is a nonlinear relationship between corruption and haze pollution. The main results are as follows. (1) The corruption perception index (CPI) was negatively correlated with haze pollution and had a strong and stable explanatory power for the heterogeneity of haze pollution. Besides, the degree of corruption had a significant triple threshold effect on haze pollution. When the CPI crossed the double threshold value, strengthening institutional quality could inhibit haze pollution. (2) Per capita GDP significantly determined how institutional quality exerted an effect on haze pollution, which was also a key factor affecting spatial heterogeneity of PM2.5 concentration. In high-income countries, choosing a more honest ruling party could substantially reduce haze pollution, while in low-income countries, an incompetent government could increase the degree of haze pollution. (3) The \"Matthew effect\" was manifested in our study. It indicated that the higher was the level of economic development, the lower was the severity of haze pollution. Based on these results, we state that policy makers cannot simply alleviate haze pollution through anti-corruption construction.

We applied the EPSM method to five data groups with different numbers and distributions of sample sites for prediction. The results showed that the EPSM method performs better than the soil-land inference model (SoLIM) method regardless the value of ut and thus can be used to estimate the soil property values well at most unknown sites.

Culex pipiens pallens and Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus are two medically concerned mosquito species in temperate and tropical areas, which serve as important disease-transmitting pests of a variety of diseases. The ongoing geographical expansion of these mosquitoes has brought an increasing threat to public health.RESULTS Based on mosquito occurrence records and high-resolution environmental layers, an ecological niche model was established to model their current and future potential distribution in China. Our model showed that the current suitable area for Cx. p. pallens is distributed in the central, eastern and northern parts of China, while Cx. p. quinquefasciatus is distributed in vast areas in southern China. Under future climate change scenarios, both species are predicted to expand their range to varying degrees and RCP 8.5 provides the largest expansion. Northward core shifts will occur in ranges of both species. Environmental variables which have significant impact on the distribution of mosquitoes were also revealed by our model.CONCLUSION Severe habitat expansion of vectors is likely to occur in the future 21st century. Our models mapped the high-risk areas and risk factors which needs to be paid attention. The results of our study can be referenced in further ecological surveys and will guide the development of strategies for the prevention and control of vector-borne diseases.

The measurement and prediction of the HFMD incidence can be combined to improve the estimation accuracy, and provide a novel perspective to explore the spatiotemporal patterns and determinant factors of an HFMD epidemic. Methods In this study, we collected weekly HFMD incidence reports for a total of 138 districts in Shandong province, China, from May 2008 to March 2009. A Kalman filter was integrated with geographically weighted regression (GWR) to estimate the HFMD incidence. Spatiotemporal variation characteristics were explored and potential risk regions were identified, along with quantitatively evaluating the influence of meteorological and socioeconomic factors on the HFMD incidence. Results The results showed that the average error covariance of the estimated HFMD incidence by district was reduced from 0.3841 to 0.1846 compared to the measured incidence, indicating an overall improvement of over 50% in error reduction. Furthermore, three specific categories of potential risk regions of HFMD epidemics in Shandong were identified by the filter processing, with manifest filtering oscillations in the initial, local and long-term periods, respectively. Amongst meteorological and socioeconomic factors, the temperature and number of hospital beds per capita, respectively, were recognized as the dominant determinants that influence HFMD incidence variation. Conclusions The estimation accuracy of the HFMD incidence can be significantly improved by integrating a Kalman filter with GWR and the integration is effective for exploring spatiotemporal patterns and determinants of an HFMD epidemic. Our findings could help establish more accurate HFMD prevention and control strategies in Shandong. The present study demonstrates a novel approach to exploring spatiotemporal patterns and determinant factors of HFMD epidemics, and it can be easily extended to other regions and other infectious diseases similar to HFMD.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Hand;Foot and mouth disease;Kalman filter;Geographically weighted regression;Spatiotemporal pattern;Determinant factors;METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS;CHILDHOOD HAND;DATA ASSIMILATION;CLIMATE FACTORS;ENTEROVIRUS 71;AIR-POLLUTION;TIME-SERIES;CROP MODEL;CHINA;COEFFICIENTS", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Jiangxi Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Environm, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health", "wos_categories": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"}

Numerous researches have shown that the spatial-temporal patterns of asthma are inconsistent, leading to the suggestion that these patterns are determined by multiple factors. This study aims to detect spatial-temporal clusters of asthma and analyze socio-ecological factors associated with the asthma hospitalization rate in Guangxi, China.Methods: Asthma hospitalization and socio-ecological data for 88 counties/municipal districts in Guangxi, China in 2015 was collected. Space-time scan statistics were applied to identify the high-risk periods and areas of asthma hospital admissions. We further used GeoDetector and Spearman correlation coefficient to investigate the socio-ecological factors associated with the asthma hospitalization rates.Results: There were a total of 7804 asthma admissions in 2015. The high-risk period was from April to June. The age groups of 0-4 and >= 65 years were both at the highest risk, with hospital admission rates of 45.0/10(5) and 46.5/10(5), respectively. High-risk areas were found in central and western Guangxi with relative risk (RR) values of asthma hospitalizations greater than 2.0. GDP per capita and altitude were positively associated with asthma hospitalizations, while air pressure and wind speed had a negative association. The explanatory powers of these factors (i.e., GDP per capita, altitude, air pressure, wind speed) were 22%, 20%, 14% and 10%, respectively.Conclusions: The GDP per capita appears to have the strongest correlation with asthma hospitalization rates.

Here, we explored the influence of environmental factors on STP content under different levels of soil erosion in the small watershed of Nanliao River, a tributary of Xiu River in the western part of Poyang Lake Plain in Jiangxi Province, China.

First,an extended framework highlighting the tradeoffs between built-up land and green space in urban regions was proposed. Second, the multi-functionality of natural land was characterized by various ecosystem services rather than merely biodiversity. To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, a practical case of green space sparing -the Ecological Red Line (ERL) policy currently implemented across China-was elaborated. Particularly, soil retention was selected as a proxy to compare the difference between green space and unprotected areas. It showed that (1) the soil retention difference between areas inside and outside the ERL continued steady before the implementing of the ERL and thereafter presented upward trend. (2) the aggregate pattern and scale of soil retention changed obvious after the implementing of the ERL. (3) environment factors underlying the spatial variation of soil retention varied in inner and outer areas of the ERL, and the ERL might ameliorate soil retention of different land use types by spill-over effect. These findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the ERL, and further supported that the green space sparing is a promising strategy for urban land management.

The current spatial distribution and patterns of EII in NC were analyzed based on geographic information system (GIS) technology. In addition, the factors that influence the level of EI were examined through a geographical detector method. The results showed that the EII value in the eastern region was significantly higher than that in the western region and that differences in EI were spatial heterogeneity. The spatial distribution of EI was analyzed at the provincial, municipal and county scales, respectively. It was found that its distribution was closely related to urban development. The spatial distribution of EI displayed longitudinal zonality. East of 104.987 degrees E, there were many large cities, such as Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao and Zhengzhou, with high population densities and developed economies. Thus, these areas had high EI values. To the west of 104.987 degrees E, such as in the Qinghai, Gansu, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia regions, the EI values were generally low, with low environmental quality and fewer human activities. The level of EI in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain region was higher than that in other areas, displaying obvious spatial dependence. Moreover, the distribution of EI exhibited high-high and low-low aggregation patterns, which accounted for 24.06% and 27.35% of the total study area, respectively. Specifically, in NC, the EI caused by human activities displayed obvious regional characteristics. In addition, the factors that influence EI were determined through a geographical detector model. The land use intensity was the direct factor related to changes in and the levels of EI, and the cover and growth of vegetation were the most important factors associated with mitigating human interference.

Therefore, scientific and efficient monitoring programmes are needed. Nitrogen is one of the most serious pollutants in the YRE. Obtaining the precise pollution areas of water quality grades (WQGs) are a scientific and management issue that requires optimization of monitoring programmes and interpolation methods. Based on spatiotemporal regression point means of surface with non-homogeneity (STR-PMSN), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations were estimated in a stratified heterogeneous estuary. The annual average areas of DIN Grades I and II were classified by interpolating the concentrations; the values were 3145 km(2), 1626 km(2), 2320 km(2) and 3758 km(2) for February, May, August and November, respectively. This means that November had the bestwater condition, and May had the worst. Meanwhile, DIN area changes showed that the water condition changed due to removal of data much more in August and May than in February and November. The descending order of importance was August, May, February and November. Every month represented different runoff periods. Monitoring frequency should not be reduced. Removal of sampling data for the third stratum had a significant effect on the area. When the sampling data for outer boundary meshes of the third stratum were removed, the water condition became worse. However, when the sampling data for inner boundary meshes were removed, the water condition improved. New sites should be added to the outer boundary region to avoid interpolation instability and reduce the sensitivity of the existing sites. This study assesses the spatiotemporal effect of the marine environmental monitoring programmes on pollutant distribution by STR-PMSN, and it offers guidance for more precise data acquisition and processing methods in the YRE and its adjacent sea.

Numerous international metropolises are developing polycentric forms under the process of suburbanization in conjunction with rapid urbanization, generating new UHI spatial patterns in internal urban areas. To comprehensively understand the effects of multi-factors on the thermal environment, our study examined a typical polycentric city, Tianjin. According to the concept of polycentrism, this study focused on three types of city \"centers\": major city core, new district core and industrial park. Eleven potential driving factors of LST were explored from four layers, and the geo-detector model was applied to rank the explanatory degree of these factors on LST. Three different city centers of the polycentric city showed varied UHI spatial pattern characteristics, and their response to the effect of natural factors and social factors on LST were quite diverse. Heat island areas were distributed homogeneously in the major city core; the UHI pattern on the east-west axis was unbalanced in the new district core due to the unsaturated urban space and dynamic planning policies; in industrial park, production areas were segregated by green belts with clear boundaries. For the whole city and the major city core, the imperviousness factor had the highest explanatory rate for LST, followed by the greenness factor. In contrast to the results of previous studies, the wetness factors had a greater impact on LST in the new district core and industrial park, second only to the greenness factor. Furthermore, selected factors exhibited bilinear or nonlinear enhanced relationships in their interactions. The driving laws of LST in different city centers were summarized with an explorative case study, aimed at providing theoretical basis and practical guidance for optimizing urban thermal environment planning, especially for highly urbanized polycentric cities.

First, the QTP was divided into the northwestern arid, middle semi-arid/semi-humid, and southeastern humid climatic sub-regions by grouping analysis. Second, based on modified weighted k-nearest neighbour model, daily precipitation of target locations in these climatic sub-regions were predicted by weighted regression of a group of gauge observations that have the largest SEP with the target locations.

The objective of this study was to map the spatial-temporal distribution of HFMD incidence and quantify the long-term effects of temperature fluctuations on HFMD incidence in children. HFMD cases in children under five, from January 2009 to December 2013, in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei provinces of China, were used in this study. The GeoDetector and Bayesian space-time hierarchy models were employed to explore the spatial-temporal association between temperature fluctuations and HFMD incidence. The results indicate that HFMD incidence had significant spatial stratified heterogeneity (GeoDetector q-statistic = 0.83, p < 0.05), and that areas with higher risk mainly appeared in metropolises and their adjacent regions. HFMD transmission was negatively associated with temperature fluctuations. A 1 degrees C increase in the standard deviation of maximum and minimum temperatures was associated with decreases of 8.22% and 11.87% in the risk of HFMD incidence, respectively. The study suggests that large temperature fluctuations affect virus growth or multiplication, thereby inhibiting the activity of the virus and potentially even leading to its extinction, and consequently affecting the spatial-temporal distribution of HFMD.

In water and sediment, the mean heavy metal concentrations yearly decreased from 2012 to 2016. The Chongming area was significantly lower than those found in the other areas, which is the least affected area by anthropogenic activities.

To overcome this problem, an ingenious method for soil mapping was proposed based on the relationships between vegetative growth and soil fertility. Six multispectral images of a winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) field were captured from October 2017 to March 2018 every month by using an unmanned aircraft system.

The combination analysis across spatial resolutions, which is rare, helps explore the comprehensive relationship between urban fragmentation and CO2 emissions. This study compared the relationships between urban form fragmentation and CO2 emissions in an urban system through the analytic framework composed of the Pearson correlation analysis, geographically weighted regression (GWR), and geographical detector methods with the use of multi-source data to construct the CO2 emissions maps. As the result, there was less fragmentation with a 500-m spatial resolution (R-500m) than with a 30-m spatial resolution (R-30m). In terms of the GWR analysis, the coarse resolution resulted in: 1) positive coefficients of fragmentation metric becoming negative, and 2) greater absolute values of negative coefficients. As to the results of Geographical detector, single factor impact powers and interactions among fragmentation factors showed a weakening effect at R(30)m but a strengthening and weakening effect at R-500m. However, there were common results observed in low-fragmented areas across different scales. That is, in low-fragmented mixed-function areas and industrial areas, the more fragmented the area was, the less the CO2 emission there would be. However, in low-fragmented residential, administrative and public service areas, the more fragmented the area was, the higher the CO2 emission there would be. Therefore, the government should disperse the mixed function zones and industrial parcels with diverse types of land, and build the contiguous residential and public service land in the low fragmentation area of urban system.

This industry is still developing, so it is important to understand what drives environmental changes, particularly in NPP, when shale gas pads are constructed in sensitive areas. Few previous studies have addressed this issue, so we quantified how the NPP changed, and what drove the changes, when a large shale gas area was developed at the end of 2012 in a mountainous karst area in Sichuan Province. We calculated the trend in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 2012 to 2017 and used the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model to calculate the changes in NPP at different distances from the pads using remote sensing images for July 2012 and July 2017 and field survey data from July 2017. We then identified the factors that drove the changes with Geodetector. The results showed that the NDVI increased across 64.2% of the shale gas development area from 2012 to 2017 because of climate change, and only showed a significant decrease across 0.3% of the area, mainly because of the shale gas development. The NPP decreased by 110.1 t because of the shale gas development in July 2017, or by about 0.35% of the total NPP. Of this, 93.8 t were associated with the pad construction areas, and 16.3 t were associated with the area around the pads. The changes in NPP around the shale gas pads were mainly confined to within 150 m during the construction phase and 90 m once the construction was completed. The NPP at different distances from the pads during the construction period was related to the distance from the pad, slope, and land use. Once completed, the NPP mainly varied with distance, land use, and the distance from the pad to rural settlements. The NPP was most strongly influenced by the distance from the pad and the area of the pad. We suggest that, when planning the construction of shale gas pads, the pads should be sited on gently sloping areas, the number of wells on each pad should be optimized, land use type changes outside the pad should be limited, and the land beyond the pads should be reclaimed in a timely manner to allow the NPP to recover.

Measuring the effect of LC on agricultural production (ELCAP) is helpful for the planning of LC activities. In the past, it is difficult to measure ELCAP at regional level due to the lack of field observation, the change of crop planting structure, and high cost of sample collection. Satellite data have large coverage and high spatiotemporal resolution for vegetation observation, which can provide a new idea for estimating ELCAP at regional level. This study aims to build a novel assessment framework to quantitatively investigate ELCAP by developing several satellite-based metrics. In addition, this study also explored the characteristics of ELCAP using the method of spatial autocorrelation and the geographical detector method in 1,281 LC areas in China. Our results show that agricultural productivity in more than 90% of total LC areas shows an increasing trend during 2001-2016. LC could play the positive but limited effects on agricultural production, and its productivity-boosting effect (64.87% of total LC areas) is greater than its stability-improving effect (46.53% of total LC areas). The spatial agglomeration of ELCAP is weak (Moran's I < 0.06), which may be resulted from the differences in field conditions and natural-social-economic situations across LC areas. The interaction between several factors has a greater effect on the ELCAP than each of these factors.

Additionally, this paper explores the impacts of various factors on the spatio-temporal dynamics of DCFG demand using the Geo-Detector method. The results demonstrate that: (1) the temporal dynamics of DCFG demand can be divided into three stages of slow growth, rapid growth, and high-level stability, and the relative level of DCFG demand in the whole animal husbandry tends to decline; (2) at the regional and national levels, the spatial concentration of high DCFG demand has intensified; in particular, North China was the region where the largest demand for DCFG was localized and was increasing at the highest rate; (3) based on the hot spot analysis of provincial DCFG demand, the high and low demand provinces of DCFG have sharp characteristic contrast from north to south China; (4) the spatio-temporal dynamics of DCFG demand in China were essentially co-affected by the four groups of factors (e.g., resource endowment, feeding scale, feeding technology, and market environment), of which resource endowment and feeding scale were the dominant factors.

The differentiation of the rental market is an indispensable and important part of the housing market in the GHMGBA and is inseparable from the creation of a livable life circle. Based on the average housing rent of 58 counties in the GHMGBA, this study summarizes the patterns and characteristics of the spatial differences in housing rents through the construction of agrading pyramid of housing rents, and displays the spatial pattern of housing rents through spatial autocorrelation analysis, cross- border rent gap comparison, and price- to- rent ratio analysis. From the theoretical perspective of leasing demand and urban fundamentals, this study constructs a model of factors influencing rent differences, consisting of population growth, per capita housing area, income level, economic level, industrial structure, and education structure. Through model comparison, a spatial lag model was used to measure the main factors influencing the housing rents in the GHMGBA. Based on the geographical detector, the study further analyzed the differences in the intensity of the factors' influence. The results showed that the housing rents in the GHMGBA generally presented a two-level difference pattern. The pattern was dominated by domestic and foreign differences between Hong Kong, Macao, and nine cities in the Pearl River Delta, as well as the differences between the core areas of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and other regions. The crossborder rent difference was the highest. Higher price-to-rent ratios were observed in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai. Income level, economic level, per capita housing area, and industrial structure had a significant impact on housing rent differences in the GHMGBA. Among them, income level had the highest impact intensity. This study responds to cross- border regional differences within the country from the perspective of housing rent. Cross- border differences are not only reflected in the population′s economic, income, and institutional levels, but also in the housing rent.

The results showed that heat flow (HF) = 84 mW/m(2) is a critical point for the relevant mechanisms of heat flow with seismicity in these zones. When HF < 84 mW/m(2), the heat flow correlates negatively with the beta-value, with a correlation degree of 0.394.

Large earthquakes occur more frequently in subduction zones with younger slabs that are more buoyant. Due to zones with a high ratio of large earthquake corresponds to low beta-values, high heat flow values correspond to low beta-values. When HF > 84 mW/m(2), the heat flow correlates positively with the beta-value, with a correlation degree of 0.463. Within this interval, the increased heat flow decreases the viscosity of the rock plate and then reduces the stress. Lower stress would correspond to a smaller earthquake and then a higher beta-value. Therefore, high heat flow values correspond to high beta-values.

The results are as follows: (1) from 1980 to 2015, the wetland area continuously decreased 738 km~2 by a reduction of 16.43% and the marsh accounted for more than 75% of the wetland with the continuous decrease. In 19901995, the wetland area reduction rate was the largest. (2) From 1980 to 2015, the landscape change trend of wetland was the dominant position of the largest patch decreased, the degree of fragmentation increased, the spatial distribution tended to be discrete, and the landscape connectivity weakened. The change characteristics of the marsh were similar to those of wetland, while the change characteristics of waters were different. (3) From 1980 to 2015, the wetland loss was mainly distributed on both sides of Wuyuer River, middle reaches of Shuangyang River, and the tail of the basin, which was mainly transformed into paddy field, dry land, grassland and saline-alkali land, with a total transfer probability of about 20%. (4) The climatic factors were the main factors leading to the loss of wetland, with 50% contribution rate. Precipitation was negatively correlated with wetland loss, and its impact was greater on wetland loss when annual precipitation was less than 450 mm. There was a positive correlation between temperature improvement and wetland loss, and its impact was greater on wetland loss when temperature improvement exceeded 1.4 ℃.

Farming households that are out of absolute poverty are still in relative poverty and have high poverty vulnerability. They are still far from the average development level of rural residents nation- wide and in the province. Therefore, the task of preventing and alleviating relative poverty in Fugong County is arduous. 2) Under the short-term goal, the main factors contributing to poverty are the number of years of education for the labor force, sanitary toilets, safe housing, per capita net income of the family, and family health; under the medium- and long-term goals, compared with the national and provincial levels, the main development weaknesses are per capita net income of the family, education for the labor force, and safe housing. 3) Affected by infrastructure, terrain, economic geographical location, natural resources, and traffic location, the spatial distribution characteristics of poor farming households at different development levels are very different.

In this country, Shaanxi Province is one of the top regions with the highest HFRS incidence in the past years. It is of great importance to explore the potential influences on the spatiotemporal variations of HFRS epidemics across this province, which would provide useful clues for local authorities making targeted interventions on this disease.The county-level HFRS incidence rates during 2005-2017, as well as some potential natural and socioeconomic variables, were collected and analyzed by using spatial auto-correlation and hot-spot analysis tools as well as a Geodetector tool to explore the spatiotemporal relationships between the incidence rates and the potential variables. The HFRS epidemics in Shaanxi Province were obviously higher than the national level and presented clear temporal fluctuation and spatial clustering at the county scale. More than 90% of the counties with relatively high HFRS incidence rates concentrated in the Guanzhong Plain where obvious spatial heterogeneity was also observed. Some variables including the percentage of plain area and construction land, and population density separately accounted for about 20% of spatial variations of the county-level epidemic across the whole province. By comparison, the spatial pattern of this epidemic in the Guanzhong Plain with no obvious socioeconomic differences was mainly affected by precipitation, normalized difference vegetation index, and land-use types. Thus, the Guanzhong Plain with both spatially clustering higher incidence rates and obviously differentiated natural and socioeconomic conditions was the crucial region of the HFRS prevalence across Shaanxi Province.

We used the flexible spatial scanning statistical method to identify the severely impoverished counties among the poverty- stricken counties with PPI>1.63, which had higher poverty rate and difficulty in poverty alleviation. Finally, we diagnose dominant factors that differentiate severely impoverished counties, and identify the dynamic mechanism of regional extreme poverty differentiation using the geodetector model. Besides, we construct a theoretical basis for anti- poverty in rural China. The results show that NII and PPI spatial distributions are highly consistent at provincial, municipal, and county levels, with a significant distribution pattern: high in eastern China and low in western China. In contrast, SEPAI has relatively low spatial consistency at provincial, municipal, and county levels. The PPI poverty distribution pattern tends toward large dispersion, small aggregation dividing across the Heihe-Bose Line. A total of 655 poverty- stricken counties were identified, mainly distributed in major ecologically functional and agricultural production areas in China. High risk areas identified by spatial scanning are mainly distributed in the northwest, southwest minority, and border areas. We also identified 208 severely impoverished counties, mostly located in inter-provincial fringe areas. The geodetector model identified seven dominant impoverishing factors, with significant differences between the four identified rural extreme poverty types: terrain detail oriented, location traffic dominated, economic income leading, and ecoenvironment constrained regions.", "abstract_ch": "从自然和社会经济因素中选取贫困的影响因子,建立评价指标体系,通过Pearson相关分析确定了贫困的主要影响因素,利用GIS空间分析和BP人工神经网络,分别模拟了省域、市域和县域3个尺度下的自然致贫指数与社会经济消贫指数,进一步计算获得了3个尺度下的贫困压力指数,对其空间分布格局进行分析;借助Flexible空间扫描探测识别出深度贫困县,在此基础上运用地理探测器揭示其主导致贫因素,并提出差别化的减贫对策建议。结果表明:①省域、市域、县域3个尺度的自然致贫指数和贫困压力指数在空间分布上具有较高的一致性,呈现出明显的东低西高的空间分布格局;社会经济消贫指数的空间分布一致性不高,县域尺度更为破碎。以黑河百色线为界,县域贫困压力指数在空间上表现出大分散、小聚集的分布状态。识别出的全国贫困县共计655个,主要分布在重点生态功能区和农产品主产区。② 3个尺度下,空间扫描识别出的贫困高风险区主要分布在西北、西南少数民族和边疆地区。县域尺度下识别出208个深度贫困县,多位于省际边缘区。③地理探测器识别出深度贫困县的7个致贫主导因素,按照主导因素将深度贫困县划分为地形要素制约型、区位交通制约型、经济收入制约型和生态环境制约型4类。", "keywords_en": "extreme poverty; spatial poverty; spatial scan detect; geodetector; differentiation mechanism; poverty identification", "keywords_ch": "深度贫困; 空间贫困; 空间扫描探测; 地理探测器; 分异机制; 贫困识别", "address_en": "Pan Jinghu,College of Geography and Environmental Science of Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730070, China.Feng Yaya,College of Geography and Environmental Science of Northwest Normal University;;Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, CAS, ;;, Lanzhou;;Lanzhou, ;; 730070;;730000.", "address_ch": "潘竟虎,西北师范大学地理与环境科学学院, 兰州, 甘肃 730070, 中国.冯娅娅,西北师范大学地理与环境科学学院;;中国科学院西北生态环境资源研究院, ;;, 兰州;;兰州, ;; 730070;;730000.", "research_areas": "Agriculture", "wos_categories": ""}

With the development of multi-centralized Chinese cities, the gravity model must be validated because several relevant external conditions have changed. The purpose of this study is to validate Huff's Gravity Model using an individual mobile trajectory of mobile communication user in 2015. We follow Huff's two-step validation method: variable validation and parameter correction. Our main conclusions are as follows. First, attractions of commercial and employment centres conform to the law of the gravity model in which the attraction is proportional to the scale of a centre and inversely proportional to the distance from a centre. Second, in the spatial scale of Shanghai central city with spatial units in a 200-m grid, the mean distance exponent for commercial centres is 2.5 and that for employment centres is 3.0. The distance decay for commuting is greater than that for shopping trips, which means commuting is more sensitive to distance. Third, the gravity model can be used to predict the influence areas of adjusted commercial and employment centres based on validated variables and corrected parameters. Our results indicate that the prediction accuracies can reach 78.5% and 71.9% for the commercial and employment centres, respectively. The prediction accuracy for employment centres is slightly lower. This is because the attraction of employment centres is influenced not only by distance but also by factors such as family and housing prices, which will affect the prediction results. Lastly, in this study, we verify the spatial stratified heterogeneity of distance decay and determine that the distance exponent is not a unique constant because it has different values in different areas. Factors such as accessibility, distance to each centre, distance to a subway station and population density will affect distance decay.", "abstract_ch": "长期以来由于规模变量、距离衰减系数取值缺乏依据,引力模型在城市研究中的应用容易受到质疑,加之中国城市的多中心化使得模型应用的外部条件发生改变,模型验证工作的必要性再次显现。本文使用2015年移动通信用户的个体移动轨迹数据,使用Huff当年的验证方法,通过变量检验、参数校正两个步骤,验证Huff的引力模型。研究发现:①城市内部商业中心和就业中心的吸引力与中心的规模呈正比,与距中心的距离呈反比,符合引力模型规律。②在上海中心城区空间尺度、200 m网格空间单元下,商业中心吸引力的距离衰减系数平均值为2.5,就业中心吸引力的距离衰减系数平均值为3.0,表明居民就业通勤对距离更加敏感,距离衰减比购物出行更加显著。③经变量检验、参数校正后的引力模型可用于对商业中心、就业中心优化调整后的势力范围进行预测,预测准确率可分别达到78.5%和71.9%。就业中心势力范围预测准确性略低,这是由于就业中心吸引力衰减除受距离影响外,还受家庭、房价等因素影响,会对预测结果产生扰动。最后,研究还证实了距离衰减系数存在空间分层异质性:距离衰减系数不是唯一值,受道路可达性、至就业(商业)中心距离、至地铁站距离、人口密度影响,不同地区的距离衰减系数存在较显著差异。", "keywords_en": "gravity model; multi-centre; model validation; distance decay; spatial stratified heterogeneity; individual mobile trajectory", "keywords_ch": "引力模型; 多中心; 模型验证; 距离衰减; 空间分层异质性; 个体移动轨迹", "address_en": "Ding Liang,College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, China.Niu Xinyi,College of Architecture and Urban Planning, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China.Song Xiaodong,College of Architecture and Urban Planning, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China.", "address_ch": "丁亮,浙江工业大学建筑工程学院, 杭州, 浙江 310014, 中国.钮心毅,同济大学建筑与城市规划学院, 上海 200092, 中国.宋小冬,同济大学建筑与城市规划学院, 上海 200092, 中国.", "research_areas": "Business & Economics", "wos_categories": ""}

It is necessary to explore the relationship between UVs and vector for effectively dealing with these problems. In this study, land-use types, including UVs, normal construction land (NCL), unused land (UL), vegetation, and water, were retrieved from the high-resolution remotely sensed imagery in the central area of Guangzhou in 2017. The vector density from May to October in 2017, including Aedes. albopictus (Ae. albopictus)'s Breteau index (BI), standard space index (SSI), and adult density index (ADI) were obtained from the vector surveillance system implemented by the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Furthermore, the spatial and temporal patterns of vector monitoring sites and vector density were analyzed on a fine scale, and then the Geodetector tool was further employed to explore the relationships between vector density and land-use types. The monitoring sites were mainly located in NCL (55.70%-56.44%) and UV (13.14%-13.92%). Among the total monitoring sites of BI (79), SSI (312), and ADI (326), the random sites accounted for about 88.61%, 97.12%, and 98.47%, respectively. The density of Ae. albopictus was temporally related to rainfall and temperature and was obviously differentiated among different land-use types. Meanwhile, the grids with higher density, which were mostly concentrated in the Pearl River fork zone that collects a large number of UVs, showed that the density of Ae. albopictus was spatially associated with the UVs. Next, the results of the Geodetector illustrated that UVs posed great impact on the density of Ae. albopictus across the central region of Guangzhou. We suggest that the number of monitoring sites in the UVs should be appropriately increased to strengthen the current vector surveillance system in Guangzhou.

Spatial pattern characteristics and identification of factors that influence water yield are the basis for decision making. However, there are limited studies on the driving mechanisms that affect the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem services. In this study, we used the Hengduan Mountain region in Southwest China, with obvious spatial heterogeneity, as the research site. The water yield module in the InVEST software was used to simulate the spatial distribution of water yield. Also, quantitative attribution analysis was conducted for various geomorphologic and climatic zones in the Hengduan Mountain region by using the geographical detector method. Influencing factors, such as climate, topography, soil, vegetation type, and land use type and pattern, were taken into consideration for this analysis. Four key findings were obtained. First, water yield spatial heterogeneity are influenced most by climate-related factors, among which precipitation and evapotranspiration are the dominant factors. Second, the relative importance of each impact factor to the water yield heterogeneity differs significantly by geomorphologic and climatic zones. In flat areas, the influence of evapotranspiration is higher than that of precipitation. As relief increases, the importance of precipitation increases and eventually, it becomes the most important factor. Evapotranspiration is the most important factor in a plateau climatic zone, while in the mid-subtropical zone, precipitation is the main controlling factor. Third, land use type is also an important driving force in flat areas. Thus, more attention should be paid to urbanization and land use planning, which involves land use changes, to mitigate the impact on water yield spatial pattern. The fourth finding was that a risk detector showed that Primarosol and Anthropogenic soil areas, shrub areas, and areas with slopes <5° and 25°-35° should be recognized as water yield important zones, while the corresponding elevation values are different in different geomorphologic and climatic zones.

Consequently, this article proposed a novel method about SUHI intensity estimation for the multicenters (mcSUHII) of urban agglomeration in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GHMBay) using nighttime light (NTL) data (i.e., DMSP/OLS) obtained in October, 2010. The mcSUHII method considered the RLST of SUHII estimation based on multicenter structure, and was more flexible to adapt the impact of human activity intensity. The study showed that compared with other RLSTs, such as suburban and forest, mcSUHII mitigates the underestimation bias caused by ignoring the multicenter structure. Importantly, the change in SUHII for urban agglomerations is greater than for a single city. Moreover, it was illustrated that the variation of SUHII presented an obvious inverted U-shape along the gradient from the inland to the coastal cities. The highest SUHIIs in the delta cities at day and night are similar to 7.27 +/- 1.71 degrees C and similar to 4.46 +/- 1.42 degrees C, respectively. Additionally, NTL served as the dominator together with other factors that were capable of explaining more than 90% of the spatial variation in SUHII in GHMBay.

Meanwhile, agricultural production, serving as the primary stage of biobased products, is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nutrient releases. Environmental impacts of agricultural production influenced by farming practices, soil properties, and climate conditions, are often site-specific and time dependent. Although assessing spatially and temporally explicit environmental releases and impacts are required to inform a sustainable trajectory for agricultural production, such analyses are largely lacking. This study provides site-specific analysis of on-farm and supply chain emissions from corn production to demonstrate the spatio-temporal variability of environmental impacts in the U.S. Midwest states. Using process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) and the physically-based Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agroecosystem model, we estimated county-level life cycle environmental release inventories from corn production in 12 U.S. Midwest states for the period of 2000-2008. Based on the Tool for Reduction and Assessment of Chemicals and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI) impact assessment model, we quantified the corresponding life cycle global warming (GW), eutrophication (EU) and acidification (AD) impacts of corn. The results show that life cycle GW, EU and AD of corn production varied by factors of 4.2, 83.7 and 10.6, respectively, across the Midwest counties over the nine-year span (2000-2008). Life cycle GWimpacts of producing 1 kg of corn ranged from -6.4 in Franklin County, Illinois to 20.2 kg CO2-eq. in Perkins County, South Dakota. The life cycle EU impacts also spanned over a wide range of 0.99 g in Morton County, Kansas to 82.9 g N-eq. in Leelanau County, Michigan, whereas life cycle AD impacts ranged from 1.3 in Clermont County, Ohio to 100.7 g SO2-eq. in Perkins County, South Dakota. Moreover, trade-offs existed among life cycle GW, EU and AD impact categories for corn production. The spatial variation analyses showed that key contributors were the different soil types, precipitation, elevation and the amounts of fertilizers applied. These findings provided critical insight into spatio-temporal variations of life cycle environmental impacts of corn production and identified spatial hotspots and top contributors for improving environmental performances of corn production.

In addition,the interaction of two factors played a more important role in affecting NO_x emissions than each factor separately. Furthermore,the interaction of urban population factor and per capita GDP factor had the biggest impact on NO_x emissions,followed by the interaction of total industrial output and vehicle stock,and the interaction of per capita GDP and urban built-up area. ④The risk area detector analysis results revealed that 6 socio-economic influencing factors,namely,urban population,per capita GDP,total industrial output,urban built-up area,electricity consumption and vehicle stock drove up NO_x emissions.

The Geodetector is used to investigate the drivers of differences in the development of people's livelihood in the ten major urban agglomerations. Research Findings: During the sample period,the development of people's livelihood in the ten major urban agglomerations showed a significant upward trend, but the differences among urban agglomerations were significant.

We analyzed the spatial distribution pattern, connection intensity and spatial autocorrelation of highway passenger flow in Chongqing during the working day, weekend and May Day and revealed the influencing factors by means of a geographic detector. Three key conclusions resulted from this research. First, highway passenger flow in Chongqing districts exhibits spatial agglomeration that is clearly higher in western Chongqing than in eastern Chongqing and forms an obviously dual-core \"star\" structure, with the main urban area and Wanzhou serving as the core. Second, a factor detector notes that the nighttime light area index (0.9251, 0.9512, 0.9541) has the strongest explanatory power for the spatial differentiation of passenger traffic in Chongqing districts, which is the key factor.

However, quantifying the effects of multiple climatic factors to vegetation activities is challenging. Using the geographical detector model (GDM), this study quantifies the relative contributions of climatic factors including precipitation, relative humidity, solar radiation, and air temperature to the interannual variation (IAV) of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the northern grasslands of China during 2000 to 2016. The results show heterogeneous spatial patterns of determinant climatic factors on the IAV of NDVI. Precipitation and relative humidity jointly controlled the IAV of NDVI, illustrating more explanatory power than solar radiation and air temperature, and accounting for higher proportion of area as the determinant factor in the study region. It is noteworthy that relative humidity, a proxy of atmospheric aridity, is as important as precipitation for the IAV of NDVI. The contribution of climatic factors to the IAV of NDVI varied by vegetation type.

This research aims to explore the spatial distribution characteristics and its influencing factors of soil salinity and moisture in the oasis farmland of arid areas. In this paper, GIS and geostatistics methods were applied to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics and variability of soil salinity and moisture, and then the corresponding proxy variables were used to quantitatively study the influence factors by using the geographical detector model. The results showed the coefficients of the variation of soil salinity and moisture to be 71.25% and 31.89%, respectively. There was moderate spatial autocorrelation of soil salinity and moisture. Soil salinity in the southwest was higher than in the northeast, and soil moisture in the northwest and southeast were lower than in the center and the northeast edge. The main influencing factors were available phosphorus, roughness of terrain, alkaline nitrogen, available potassium, and elevation.

Therefore, a three-agent analytical framework for determinants of urban wet market vendor profit was developed.

The study shows obvious spatial differentiation in the profits of wet market vendors across the city and draws several conclusions. Profitability is mainly related to the demographic features of vendors, their business expenses, and payment schemes. It is also related to broader socioeconomic factors at the district level, including local GDP, average income, urban infrastructure, and number of residential neighborhoods. The characteristics of vendors and their businesses have a more significant relationship with business profit than district socio-economic factors.

The spatial characteristics and vegetation composition of urban greenspace have a great influence on its cooling capacity. Objectives We sought to distinguish the cooling effect by different spatial pattern factors of greenspace and by the interaction of these factors, which may be useful in understanding cooling effect and designing urban greenspace. Methods Both the greenspace derived from SPOT6 and LST retrieved from Landsat-8 images are employed to identify the dominant factors influencing LST and investigate the interaction between any two dominant factors in the Beijing metropolitan area. Results The results indicate that the dominant spatial factors affecting LST vary by greenspace type, i.e., for grass, the number of patches (NP) and patch density (PD) have a significant effect on LST while for coniferous forest, the landscape shape index (LSI) is the dominant spatial factor. And the NP and percentage of landscape are the dominant spatial factors for broad-leaved forest and mixed forest, respectively.

Various infectious arbovirus diseases can be transmitted by Ae. aegypti. With ongoing global climate change, we are facing an increasing public health threat from the rapid spread of disease vectors into wider geographical areas. To better understand the current ecological niche range and possible future expansion of Ae. aegypti, an ecological niche modelling approach was adopted to predict its current and future potential habitat in Taiwan, China. RESULTS Based on observed occurrence records and environmental layers reflecting climate and land-use conditions, predictions with a high resolution of 30 arcsec (approx. 1 x 1 km) were made by our model. Ae. aegypti was predicted to expand its habitat in varying degrees out of its current niche range under different climate scenarios for the future 21st century. Winter temperature and dry season precipitation were considered as important predictors among climate variables. Croplands, pasture, forested lands and urban lands were important land-use variables. CONCLUSION Ae. aegypti is expected to establish new habitats out of its current niche range under the trend of global climate change. The extent of habitat expansion varies under different climate scenarios. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent its expansion to a broader scale.

Systematically exploring the general distribution characteristics, influential factors and classification of CLF are of great significance for improving regional agricultural production capacity, promoting resource conservation and intensive use, and ensuring national food security, especially at the regional scale. In this study, we established a new conceptual index system using multivariable linear regression, geographical detectors, and magic cube model for CLF assessment as well as an analysis of the spatial differentiation characteristics, driving mechanism and management zoning trade-off of CLF in Jiangsu Province in eastern China based on multi-source data characterizing geographic, land-use and socio-economic information. The results showed that the connotation of CLF has spatial-scale characteristics due to the differences in functions positioning of cultivated land resources in macro-social security and micro-livelihood maintenance. At the national/regional scale, CLF mainly covers the natural (resource), spatial and utilization attributes of cultivated land. Based on this, the CLFI in Jiangsu presents a spatial pattern that gradually increases from north to south, with significant spatial differences. Besides, the CLFI within built-up areas is significantly higher than that outside built-up areas, and its fractal dimensions both within and outside the urban planning built-up areas show the spatial pattern of \"spatial distribution > resource endowment > convenience of utilization\".

Previous studies have indicated that lung cancer incidence exhibits remarkable spatial heterogeneity, and lung cancer is related to outdoor air pollution. However, the non-linear spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence in China remains unclear.MethodsIn this study, the relationships between the lung cancer incidence of males and females from 207 counties in China in 2013 with annual concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O-3 were analysed. GeoDetector q statistic was used for examining the non-linear spatial association between outdoor air pollution and incidence of lung cancer.ResultsAn apparent spatial and population gender heterogeneity was found in the spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence. Among the six selected pollutants, SO2 has the greatest influence on lung cancer (q=0.154 in females) in north China. In the south, each selected pollutant has a significant impact on males or females, and the mean q value in the south is 0.181, which is bigger than that in the north (q=0.154). In addition, the pollutants have evident non-linear interaction effects on lung cancer. In north China, the interaction between SO2 and PM2.5 is the dominant interaction, with q values of 0.207 in males and 0.334 in females. In the south, the dominant interactive factors are between SO2 and O-3 in males and between SO2 and CO in females, with q values of 0.45, 0.232 respectively. Smoking is a substantial contributor to lung cancer among men, either in South or North China, with q value of 0.143 and 0.129 respectively, and the interaction between smoking and air pollutants increases this risk.ConclusionsThis study implies that the influence of SO2 and PM2.5 on lung cancer should be focused on in north China, and in the south, the impact of O-3 and CO as well as their interaction with SO2 need to be paid more attention.

Studies that consider only individual-level variables can suffer from residual confounding. This can result in individual variables that are unrelated to risk behaving as proxies for uncaptured information. There is a scarcity of literature on risk factors for snakebite. In this study, we evaluate the individual-level risk factors of snakebite in Sri Lanka and highlight the impact of spatial confounding on determining the individual-level risk effects.MethodsData was obtained from the National Snakebite Survey of Sri Lanka. This was an Island wide community-based survey. The survey sampled 165,665 individuals from all 25 districts of the country. We used generalized linear models to identify individual-level factors that contribute to an individual's risk of experiencing a snakebite event. We fitted separate models to assess risk factors with and without considering spatial variation in snakebite incidence in the country.ResultsBoth spatially adjusted and non-adjusted models revealed that middle-aged people, males, field workers and individuals with low level of education have high risk of snakebites. The model without spatial adjustment showed an interaction between ethnicity and income levels. When the model included a spatial adjustment for the overall snakebite incidence, this interaction disappeared and income level appeared as an independent risk factor. Both models showed similar effect sizes for gender and age. HEmployment and education showed lower effect sizes in the spatially adjusted model.ConclusionsBoth individual-level characteristics and local snakebite incidence are important to determine snakebite risk at a given location. Individual level variables could act as proxies for underling residual spatial variation when environmental information is not considered.

We then employ a novel method, specifically, the geographical detector, from the perspective of spatial stratified heterogeneity to reveal the potential impacts and interaction impacts of the natural and socioeconomic factors on air pollution. The results are as follows. (1) The grey relational degree results reveal that all factors in the topographical and meteorological layer, pollution sources layer, economic development layer, and urbanization layer have high relational degrees, indicating that these factors are closely correlated with air pollution. (2) The factor detector analysis reveals that the PM2.5 factor has the biggest q value, indicating that it is the primary contributor to air pollution, followed by PM10 and elevation.

Moreover, the interactions between pair factors of pollution sources are the strongest. (4) The risk detector analysis reveals that elevation and precipitation are negatively correlated with air pollution, whereas pollution and urbanization factors are positively correlated with air pollution.

First, we conclude that high spatial agglomeration, CO2 emissions centralized along the river and coastline, and a structure with three circular layers are the three notable temporal-spatial characteristics of Shanghai fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Second, we find that large point sources are the leading factors that shaped the temporal-spatial characteristics of Shanghai CO2 emission distributions. The changes of CO2 emissions in each grid during 2010-2015 indicate that the energy-controlling policies of large point emission sources have had positive effects on CO2 reduction since 2012. The changes suggest that targeted policies can have a disproportionate impact on urban emissions. Third, area sources bring more uncertainties to the forecasting of carbon emissions. We use the Geographical Detector method to identify these leading factors that influence CO2 emissions emitted from area sources. We find that Shanghai's circular layer structure, population density, and population activity intensity are the leading factors. This result implied that urban planning has a large impact on the distribution of urban CO2 emissions. At last, we find that unbalanced development within the city will lead to different leading impact factors for each circular layer. Factors such as urban development intensity, traffic land, and industrial land have stronger power to determine CO2 emissions in the areas outside the Outer Ring, while factors such as population density and population activity intensity have stronger impacts in the other two inner areas.

Reliable estimation of nitrogen concentration in the water is crucial for assessment of the water quality of the estuary. Because ocean fronts exist in the YRE, which divide water masses into different regions, it is necessary to account for the heterogeneity of the water surface when predicting nitrogen concentrations. A new geostatistical method, called spatiotemporal point mean of surface with non-homogeneity (ST-PMSN), is proposed to model the non-stationary spatiotemporal random process of nitrogen concentrations between 2004 and 2013 in the YRE. The method considers the spatiotemporal correlation of surface water nitrogen and uses information from both sides of a boundary for heterogeneous water masses. Comparing with several other interpolating methods, including spatial ordinary kriging (OK), stratified ordinary kriging (SOK), point mean of surface with non-homogeneity (P-MSN), spatiotemporal ordinary kriging (STK), and stratified spatiotemporal ordinary kriging (SSTK), the cross-validation results show that ST-PMSN has the highest accuracy, followed by SSTK, STK, P-MSN, SOK, and OK in descending order. ST-PMSN is therefore demonstrated to be effective in estimating the nitrogen pollutant concentrations in a stratified estuary. According to interpolated nitrogen concentrations in the YRE, water quality has generally deteriorated-with fluctuations-from 2004 to 2013. The average annual reduction in area of water quality of Grades I and II from 2004 to 2013 was 1.10%. At the same time, the average annual increase in area of water quality of Grades III and IV was 0.89% and that of Grade V was 0.21%. The results of this study provide a new and more accurate interpolating method for assessing the pollutant concentration in the marine and offers guidance for more precise classification of water quality in the YRE.

The cattle hoofprints are known to be some of the productive breeding sites for Anopheles (An.) arabiensis and An. fenestus in Southern and East African countries. Therefore, this study aimed at testing the potential of integrating field data and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for mapping cattle hoofprint distribution in the Vhembe District, South Africa. The purpose was to improve the predictability of mosquito breeding sites in the study area by using field point dataset and Sentinel-2 data. Due to the difficulty of sampling all locations in the study area, the spatial interpolation was employed to create continuous surfaces of cattle hoofprints, using limited sampled point observations. The sampled point observations were then correlated with Sentinel-derived variables for predicting cattle hoofprints at unsampled locations. The ordinary Kriging (OK), co-Kriging (CK) and step-wise multiple linear regression (SMLR) were used due to their ability to incorporate both field point data and ancillary datasets. The CK was the best performing interpolation method, with R-2 = 0.69 for validation dataset (n = 33), compared to OK (R-2 = 0.57) and SMLR (R-2 = 0.25). The resulting co-Kriging semivariogram shows that the combination of field data and remote sensing dataset improves the prediction accuracy of cattle hoofprint distribution. Findings from this study demonstrated that the interpolation error for estimating cattle hoofprints/100 m(2) can be minimized greatly by using CK (RMSE = 0.2; MAD = 0.04) than with both OK (RMSE = 2.39; MAD = 2.11) and SMLR (RMSE = 5.20; MAD = 4.55) methods. Furthermore, the results from this study indicate that there is a high number of cattle hoofprints in malaria-prone areas at the study site than in the malaria-free areas.

Industrialization played a key role in the development of BTHUA, the landform type was the important factor controlling CUECS. (3) Social consumer goods, gross domestic product, the disposable income of urban residents (all per capita) are the core factors controlling CUECS within different spatial units. Urbanization rate, per capita social consumer goods, the proportion of tertiary industrial population are the core factors controlling CUECS during different urbanization development stages. (4)The relative impacts of urbanization and ecological environmental subsystems on CUECS are (in decreasing order of importance) population urbanization, economic urbanization, social urbanization, ecological environment subsystem.

In this regard, eight trace elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sb, Zn) in mosses were investigated at thirty remote mountains across China. The sources and possible factors controlling the distribution of trace elements in the mosses were identified through multivariate statistical analysis and Pb isotopic ratios. The results showed that the concentrations of trace elements in the mosses were higher than the levels in most European countries but comparable to those in Chinese cities. Mosses had the highest concentration levels of Cd and Sb and slightly lower levels of other trace elements.

Healthy and active longevity could ease the ageing burden on families and communities. To date, most studies of the oldest-old distribution are focused on a simple scale from spatial perspective, and the multi-scale spatio-temporal clusters trend in the oldest-old population has not yet been determined. Thus, the objective in present study is to use a new method to evaluate the spatio-temporal pattern and detect the risk clusters in the oldest-old population from three scales.MethodsIndividuals aged 65 years or older and individuals aged 80 years or older on three scales in China from 2000 to 2010 were used. The exploratory spatial data analysis was performed using Moran's I statistic, and the pattern of the oldest-old clusters among humans was examined by using the spatial scan statistical method. Then, spatial stratified heterogeneity was used to explore the factors affecting the spatial heterogeneity of the oldest-old population.ResultsThe oldest-old index in the southeast coastal areas is higher than that in the northwest inland areas in China. A three-ladder terrain distribution of the oldest-old index from west to east is obvious. The overall pattern of the oldest-old index evolves from a \"concave\" shape to an \"east-west uplift, and northern collapse\" shape. Space-time analysis revealed that high-risk areas were concentrated in five regions: the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, the Southeast Coast, Sichuan and Chongqing, and the Central Plains. The oldest-old cluster at different scales shows a similar pattern, but local differences exist. The risk at the prefecture scale and county scale is greater than at the interprovincial scale; the sublevel can identify clusters that have not been identified at the previous level, especially the bordering areas of prefectures and counties; and more risk units and greater relative risk are found in urban areas than in rural areas.ConclusionsThe results emphasized that spatial scan statistics can be used to estimate the spatial clusters of the oldest-old people. The detection of these clusters might be highly useful in the surveillance of the ageing phenomenon, thus helping local public health authorities measure the population burden at all locations, identifying geographical areas that require more attention, and evaluating the impacts of intervention programs.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "HEALTH;LONGEVITY;CENTENARIANS;ENVIRONMENTS;INDICATORS;DISEASE", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Nanjing Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Virtual Geog Environm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China\n[ 4 ]‎ Nanjing Normal Univ, Ginling Coll, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China\n[ 5 ]‎ Nanjing Normal Univ, Int Ctr Aging & Hlth Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Science & Technology - Other Topics", "wos_categories": "Multidisciplinary Sciences"}

This phenomenon has received little scientific attention so far. Our study contributes to advancing the understanding of its drivers. This study focuses on the effects of the seasonality of increasing social contacts on the incidence proportions at multiple district level of the childhood hand-foot-mouth disease in Da Nang city, Viet Nam from 2012 to 2016.Methods: We decomposed the nonstationary time series of the incidence proportions for the nine spatial-temporal (S-T) strata in the study area, where S indicates the spatial and T the temporal stratum. The long-term trends and the seasonality are presented by the Fourier series. To study the effects of the monthly average ambient temperature and the period of preschooling, we developed a spatial-temporal autoregressive model.Results: Seasonality of childhood hand-foot-mouth disease incidence proportions shows two peaks in all spatial strata annually: large peaks synchronously in April and small ones asynchronously during the preschooling period. The peaks of the average temperature are asynchronous with the seasonal peaks of the childhood hand-footmouth disease incidence proportions in the period between January and May, with the negative values of the regression coefficients for all spatial strata, respectively: beta(S1)(T11) = -0.18 +/- 0.07; beta(S2)(T11) = -0.25 +/- 0: 09; beta(S3)(T11) = -0.14 +/- 0.05. The increasingly cumulative preschooling period and the seasonal component of the incidence proportions are negatively correlated in the period between August and December, with the negative values of the regression coefficients for all temporal strata, respectively: beta(S1)(T32) = -0.40 +/- 0.01; beta(S2)(T32) = -0.29 +/- 0.00; beta(S3)(T32) = -0: 25 +/- 0.01.Conclusions: The study shows that social contact amongst children under five years of age is the important driving factor of the dynamics of the childhood hand-foot-mouth disease outbreaks in the study area. The preschooling season when children's contact with each other increases stimulates the geographical variation of the seasonality of childhood hand-foot-mouth disease infections at small areas in the study area.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Health seasonality;NTDs;Childhood HFMD;STAR;Fourier analysis;Disease;dynamics;health geography;small area analysis;SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATION;MOUTH-DISEASE;EPIDEMIOLOGY;DYNAMICS;MODELS;HAND", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, Enschede, Netherlands\n[ 2 ]‎ Pasteur Inst, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health", "wos_categories": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"}

The objective was to create a plant social geospatial model-geographical detector for analyzing the strength of the association between chestnut yields and their potential determinants. In this model system, we used measured data from chestnut to highlight how a geospatial model can be used to identify complex relationships among soil, plants, and geospatial location. Four geographical detectors (i.e., risk, factor, ecological, and interaction) were proposed on the basis of spatial variation analysis. The model was then applied to Qianxi County of Hebei Province in China. Soil parent material, soil texture, and total power of farm machinery were found to be the key factors. The interactive effect of any two factors increased chestnut yield, and the interaction between parent material and total power of farm machinery resulted in the highest yield.

However, the accuracy of satellite precipitation products is not high enough in some areas, and the causes of their errors are complicated. In order to better calibrate and apply the product's data, relevant research on this kind of product is required. Accordingly, this study investigated the spatial error distribution and spatial influence factors of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) post-process 3B42V7 (hereafter abbreviated as 3B42V7) data over mainland China. This study calculated accuracy indicators based on the 3B42V7 data and daily precipitation data from 797 rain gauge stations across mainland China over the time range of 1998-2012. Then, a clustering analysis was conducted based on the accuracy indicators. Moreover, the geographical detector (GD) was used to perform the error cause analysis of the 3B42V7. The main findings of this study are the following. (1) Within mainland China, the 3B42V7 data accuracy decreased gradually from the southeast coast to the northwest inland, and shows a similar distribution for precipitation. High values of systematic error (>1.0) is mainly concentrated in the southwest Tibetan Plateau, while high values of random error (>1.0) are mainly concentrated around the Tarim Basin. (2) Mainland China can be divided into three areas by the spectral clustering method. It is recommended that the 3B42V7 can be effectively used in Area I, while in Area III the product should be calibrated before use, and the product in Area II can be used after an applicability study. (3) The GD result shows that precipitation is the most important spatial factor among the seven factors influencing the spatial error distribution of the 3B42V7 data.

The spatiotemporal trends of the approximately anthropogenic PM2.5 removed natural dust (PM2.5_No Dust) concentrations and the corresponding population's PM2.5 No Dust exposure (PPM2.5E) in the global continent from 1998 to 2016 were investigated by the presented BSTHPRM. The total areas of the high and higher PM(2.5_No Dust )polluted regions, whose spatial relative magnitude of PM2.5_NoDust pollution to the global continental overall level was between 1.89 and 14.68, accounted for about 13.4% of the global land area, and the corresponding exposed populations accounted for 56.0% of the global total population. The spatial heterogeneity of the global PM2.5_NoDust pollution increased generally from 1998 to 2016. The areas of hot, warm, and cold spots with increasing trends of PM2.5_NoDust concentration initially contracted and then later expanded. The local trends of the global continental PM2.5_NoDust concentrations and PPM2.5E can be parted into three changing stages, early, medium, and later stages, using the BSTHPRM. The area proportions of the regions experiencing a decreasing trend of PM2.5_NoDust concentrations and PPM2.5E were greater in the medium stage than in the early and later stages.

Most published landslide susceptibility maps lack reliable information at the local scale due to the spatial heterogeneity being ignored. To enrich the local-scale information of LSM, multiple information fusion methods for the local spatial heterogeneity and regional trends of control factors are needed. However, no information fusion method has been proposed for LSM yet. In this paper, we developed a new integrated statistical method, named B-GeoSVC, under the hierarchical Bayesian framework for LSM. Specifically, this model applied the GeoDetector method to fit the regional trends of control factors and employed spatially varying coefficients (SVC) model to fit the local spatial heterogeneity of each control factor. Then, the regional trends and local spatial heterogeneity information were fused within the hierarchical Bayesian framework. The B-GeoSVC model was verified using data from the Duwen basin of China, which was in the central region affected by the M-S 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake that occurred on May 12, 2008. Under a cross-validation experiment, the prediction accuracy rate of the B-GeoSVC model was 86.09%, and the area under the curve was 0.93, which suggested that the B-GeoSVC model was able to achieve relatively accurate local-scale LSM and provide richer local information than traditional regional scale LSM.

Zones with a high concentration of heavy metals were closer to the road and farther from the mine area, which had low NDVI, large slope, high terrain, and large pH values. Concentrations of total heavy metals were higher in calcareous soils and in dryland and forests. Zones with a higher concentration of water-soluble heavy metals were closer to the mine and river, which had lower DEM and pH values The uncertainty of geographical detector was also analyzed on the basis of their interpolation accuracy and the stratification number of influencing factors, and we found that the existing sample numbers and the stratification number of influencing factors met the needs of geographical detector calculation.

We propose a framework for the epidemic forest approach to spatializing epidemic modeling. An epidemic forest is formed by epidemic trees, each using the tree structure to represent an epidemic starting from a primary case. Each node on the tree represents an individual case, and each link represents a parent-child transmission linkage and can be modeled with the spatiotemporal and other information about the cases. Structural, spatiotemporal, and epidemiological information can be extracted from constructed trees to characterize the epidemic they represent and to correspond to environmental data. When multiple primary cases can be determined, the forest is ready to build. We applied this method to the 2013 dengue fever epidemic in Guangzhou City, China. With the constructed forest, we particularly calculated the case reproduction ratio (R-t), an index widely used for characterizing epidemics, at the global, tree-wise, and pixel-wise scales. We further calculated correlation coefficients between these R(t)s and climate variables. R(t)s at different scales, as well as their associations with climate variables, offer information at different levels that is all important in epidemiological studies and disease control practices. Through this study, we explored and demonstrated how to spatialize epidemic modeling, what information can be extracted from this spatialization, and then how to use the extracted information.

Both environmental changes and irrational use of the grassland can result in severe grassland degradation in some areas of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. However, the magnitude and patterns of the physical and anthropogenic factors in driving grassland variation over northern Tibet remain debatable, and the interactive influences among those factors are still unclear. In this study, we employed a geographical detector model to quantify the primary and interactive impacts of both the physical factors (precipitation, temperature, sunshine duration, soil type, elevation, slope, and aspect) and the anthropogenic factors (population density, road density, residential density, grazing density, per capita GDP, and land use type) on vegetation variation from 2000 to 2015 in northern Tibet. Our results show that the vegetation index in northern Tibet significantly decreased from 2000 to 2015. Overall, the stability of vegetation types was sorted as follows: the alpine scrub > the alpine steppe > the alpine meadow. The physical factors, rather than the anthropogenic factors, have been the primary driving factors for vegetation dynamics in northern Tibet. Specifically, meteorological factors best explained the alpine meadow and alpine steppe variation. Precipitation was the key factor that influenced the alpine meadow variation, whereas temperature was the key factor that contributed to the alpine steppe variation. The anthropogenic factors, such as population density, grazing density and per capita GDP, influenced the alpine scrub variation most. The influence of population density is highly similar to that of grazing density, which may provide convenient access to simplify the study of the anthropogenic activities in the Tibet plateau. The interactions between the driving factors had larger effects on vegetation than any single factor. In the alpine meadow, the interaction between precipitation and temperature can explain 44.6% of the vegetation variation. In the alpine scrub, the interaction between temperature and GDP was the highest, accounting for 27.5% of vegetation variation. For the alpine steppe, the interaction between soil type and population density can explain 29.4% of the vegetation variation. The highest value of vegetation degradation occurred in the range of 448-469 mm rainfall in the alpine meadow, 0.61-1.23 people/km(2) in the alpine scrub and -0.83-0.15 degrees C in the alpine steppe, respectively.

Many regression models based on land use types and urban fabrics have been built to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution of air pollutants, however, few of them examined the relationship between urban morphological characteristics and the distribution of air pollutants in a megacity. This study investigates such relationships for six types of air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O-3, and CO) and a composite AQI (Air Quality Index) based on hourly data at 35 monitoring stations in Beijing in 2016, with morphological characteristics (Morphological building index), meteorological factors (Land Surface Temperature, LST), land use (vegetation, road length, gas station and industry point data), and population distribution data. We also analyzed the results with spatiotemporal regression and SSH (Spatial Stratified Heterogeneity) models respectively. According to the spatiotemporal regression model, the morphological building index (MBI) shows a strong correlation with the dispersion of PM2.5 (R-2 = 0.81) and AQI (R-2 = 0.80) in the warm season and this finding was reinforced through the Leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) analysis. From the SSH analysis, the road length in a large proximal region impacts air pollutants the most, especially for O-3; and population density significantly affects PM 2.5, AQI, SO2, and NO2 in the cold season. From an integrated interpretation, distance to nearest industry impacts the spatial distribution of NO2 in cold season, while it impacts that of PM2.5 and AQI in both warm and cold seasons.

Guangdong Province is one of the most severely affected provinces in south China. This study aims to identify the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and potential predictors of HFMD in Guangdong Province and provide a theoretical basis for the disease control and prevention. Methods: Case-based HFMD surveillance data from 2009 to 2012 was obtained from the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). The Bayesian spatiotemporal model was used to evaluate the spatiotemporal variations of HFMD and identify the potential association with meteorological and socioeconomic factors. Results: Spatially, areas with higher relative risk (RR) of HFMD tended to be clustered around the Pearl River Delta region (the mid-east of the province). Temporally, we observed that the risk of HFMD peaked from April to July and October to December each year and detected an upward trend between 2009 and 2012. There was positive nonlinear enhancement between spatial and temporal effects, and the distribution of relative risk in space was not fixed, which had an irregular fluctuating trend in each month. The risk of HFMD was significantly associated with monthly average relative humidity (RR: 1.015, 95% CI: 1.006-1.024), monthly average temperature (RR: 1.045, 95% CI: 1.021-1.069), and monthly average rainfall (RR: 1.004, 95% CI: 1.001-1.008), but not significantly associated with average GDP. Conclusions: The risk of HFMD in Guangdong showed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. There was spatiotemporal interaction in the relative risk of HFMD. Adding a spatiotemporal interaction term could well explain the change of spatial effect with time, thus increasing the goodness of fit of the model. Meteorological factors, such as monthly average relative humidity, monthly average temperature, and monthly average rainfall, might be the driving factors of HFMD.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "hand;foot;and mouth disease;Bayesian spatiotemporal models;spatiotemporal analysis;spatiotemporal interaction;potential predictors;METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS;SICHUAN PROVINCE;RISK;ASSOCIATION;VARIABLES;CHILDREN;CLIMATE;MODEL", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Med Stat & Epidemiol, 74 Zhong Shan 2nd Rd, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sun Yat Sen Global Hlth Inst, 135 Xin Gang Xi Rd, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Minist Educ, Key Lab Trop Dis & Control, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China\n[ 4 ]‎ SUNY Albany, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Rensselaer, NY 12144 USA", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health", "wos_categories": "Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"}

Based on the Geo-detector, we first attribute the spatio-temporal variation of Epan across China in 1961-2001. The results show that relative humidity is the primary factor influencing the temporal dynamics of Epan, followed by sunshine duration, maximum air temperature and wind speed.

Gastric cancer mortality (GCM) data in two periods (I: 2004-2006 and II: 2012-2015) was collected for the analysis of its spatiotemporal variations on the grid scale across S County in Central China. Some environmental and socioeconomic factors, including river, farmlands, topographic condition, population density, and gross domestic products (GDP) were obtained for the exploration of their changes and their relationships with GCM's spatiotemporal variations through a powerful tool (GeoDetector, GD). During 2004-2015, S County achieved environmental improvement and socioeconomic development, as well as a clear decline of the age-standardized mortality rate of gastric cancer from 35.66/10(5) to 23.44/10(5). Moreover, the GCM spatial patterns changed on the grid scale, which was spatially associated with the selected influencing factors. Due to the improvement of rivers' water quality, the distance from rivers posed relatively larger but reversed impacts on the gridded GCM. In addition, higher population density and higher economic level (GDP) acted as important protective factors, whereas the percentage of farmlands tended to have adverse effects on the gridded GCM in period II. It can be concluded that the decline of GCM in S County was spatiotemporally associated with increasingly strengthened environmental managements and socioeconomic developments over the past decade.

This is especially important in urban areas where metals from a wide range of sources contribute to sediment pollution. In this study, the metal enrichment factor (EF) was used to measure the watershed distribution of Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd in sediments in the Wen-Rui Tang urban river system in Wenzhou, Eastern China. The Geographical Detector Method (GDM) was specifically evaluated for its ability to analyze spatial relationships between metal EFs and their anthropogenic and natural control factors, including densities of industry (DI), livestock (DL), service industries (DS), population (DP), and roads (DR), along with agricultural area (AG), sediment total organic carbon (TOC), and soil types (ST). Results showed that the watershed was highly contaminated by all metals with an EF trend of Cd >> Zn>Cu>Pb. The spatial distribution of EFs demonstrated high contamination of all metals in the southwestern region of the watershed where industrial activities were concentrated, and higher Cu and Zn concentrations in the northeastern region having a high density of livestock production. GDM results identified DI as the dominant determinant for all metals, while TOC and ST were determined to have a moderate secondary influence for Zn, Pb and Cd. Additionally, GDM revealed several additive and nonlinear interactions between anthropogenic and natural factors influencing metal concentrations. Compared to other correlation, multiple linear regression and geographically weighted regression, GDM demonstrated distinct advantages of being able to assess both categorical and continuous variables and determine both single and multiple factor interactions.

Therefore, it is important to identify the spatial heterogeneity and influencing factors of PM2.5 concentrations for regional air quality control and management. In this study, PM2.5 data from 2000 to 2015 was determined from an inversion of NASA atmospheric remote sensing images. Using geo-statistics, geographic detectors, and geo-spatial analysis methods, the spatio-temporal evolution patterns and driving factors of PM2.5 concentration in China were evaluated. The main results are as follows. (1) In general, the average concentration of PM2.5 in China increased quickly and reached its peak value in 2006; subsequently, concentrations remained between 21.84 and 35.08 g/m(3). (2) PM2.5 is strikingly heterogeneous in China, with higher concentrations in the north and east than in the south and west. In particular, areas with relatively high PM2.5 concentrations are primarily in four regions, the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, Lower Yangtze River Delta Plain, Sichuan Basin, and Taklimakan Desert. Among them, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region has the highest concentration of PM2.5. (3) The center of gravity of PM2.5 has generally moved northeastward, which indicates an increasingly serious haze in eastern China. High-value PM2.5 concentrations have moved eastward, while low-value PM2.5 has moved westward. (4) Spatial autocorrelation analysis indicates a significantly positive spatial correlation. The High-High PM2.5 agglomeration areas are distributed in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, Fenhe-Weihe River Basin, Sichuan Basin, and Jianghan Plain regions. The Low-Low PM2.5 agglomeration areas include Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang, north of the Great Wall, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and Taiwan, Hainan, and Fujian and other southeast coastal cities and islands.

However, studies on the multi-factor synthesis are still relatively lacked. In this study, the simulation of soil erosion and its quantitative attribution analysis have been conducted in different geomorphological types in a typical karst basin based on the RUSLE model and the geodetector method. The influencing factors, such as land use type, slope, rainfall, elevation, lithology and vegetation cover, have been taken into consideration. Results show that the strength of association between the six influencing factors and soil erosion was notably different in diverse geomorphological types. Land use type and slope were the dominant factors of soil erosion in the Sancha River Basin, especially for land use type whose power of determinant (q value) for soil erosion was much higher than other factors. The q value of slope declined with the increase of relief in mountainous areas, namely it was ranked as follows: middle elevation hill> small relief mountain> middle relief mountain. Multi-factors interactions were proven to significantly strengthen soil erosion, particularly for the combination of land use type with slope, which can explain 70% of soil erosion distribution. It can be found that soil erosion in the same land use type with different slopes (such as dry land with slopes of 5 degrees and above 25 degrees) or in the diverse land use types with the same slope (such as dry land and forest with a slope of 5 degrees), varied much. These indicate that prohibiting steep slope cultivation and Grain for Green Project are reasonable measures to control soil erosion in karst areas. Based on statistics of soil erosion difference between diverse stratifications of each influencing factor, results of risk detector suggest that the amount of stratification combinations with significant difference accounted for 55% at least in small relief mountain and middle relief mountainous areas.

Bike sharing plays an important role in improving the accessibility of public transportation and reducing the motorized pollution. At the same time, it also brings out urban issues, such as excessive amount of bike sharing,and mismatch between supply and demand of bike sharing. The main reason for these problems is the lack of accurate prediction and effective scheduling for bike sharing ride. Exploring the spatial and temporal characteristics of bike sharing ride and detecting the influencing factors can provide scientific decision-making basis for precise prediction and effective scheduling of bike sharing. Even though some studies have paid attention to the influencing factors of bikesharing ride behaviors, most of them focused on the starting point but neglected the destination. Moreover, the temporal difference of influencing factors and the interaction between the factors were seldom revealed in the previous studies. Taking mobike in Guangzhou city as an example,this study aims to analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of the ride destination of bike sharing. We detect the temporal differences of the influencing factors of bike sharing ride destination,and further explores the interaction between the determinants by using geographical detector. The results show that: (1) The usage of bike sharing in morning-peak time is greater than that in evening-peak time, and the spatial distribution of bike sharing ride destination has obvious temporal differences. The ride destinations of bike sharing at morning peak period are mainly distributed at CBD, zone of information industry and job-housing balance areas. While the ride destinations at evening peak period are mainly distributed along Metro Line3 from Tiyuxi station to Huashi station as well as high-density residential areas. (2) The element of service facilities has the greatest impacts on the ride destinations of bike sharing, followed by the accessibility,land use and natural environment elements. To be more specifically, the influencing degree of the factors ranks as follows: residential communities distribution, catering facilities distribution,corporate distribution, shopping facilities distribution, road density, distance to metro station entrances and POI diversity. (3) The influence of each factor has remarkable temporal differences, for example, the influence of corporate distribution factor grows rapidly during the morning peak period.

As the most important part of the electronic commerce, E-shopping has been expanding in the last decade,which has pushed forward China into the stage of nationwide online shopping. In recent years,the development of E-shopping is in its heyday, and the research of online shopping and online consumption became more and more popular. County is the new growth point of China's Eshopping and online consumption, but the relevant research is still very deficient. Under this background, based on data from Alibaba Group, this paper tries to analyze the spatial pattern of E-shopping development in China's county applying spatial autocorrelation method, and then discusses its impact factors using Geodetector method. The results show that: (1) The development of E-shopping declined from southeastern coastal counties to the inland counties. On one hand, the counties with high SI concentrated in coastal China, especially in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. There are some high SI counties located along the strips extending from eastern coastal region to north China, and few high SI counties are scattered in inland China. On the other hand, the counties with low SI are concentrated in southwestern and northeastern China. (2) Geodetector results show that, the first-level significant influencing factors of counties' E-shopping pattern are the development of E-business (bi), regional urbanization (urb) and resident income (inc);the second-level factors are population education level (edu),regional information development level (ict) and local logistic system (lgt);while other factors have negligible impacts.

In recent years, Liupanshui has adopted a series of ecological construction projects, therefore, it is very important to quantitatively analyze soil erosion and its influencing factors. Based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation(RUSLE)model and geographical detector method, we calculated the average soil erosion modulus of Liupanshui city during 1990-2015. We analyzed the changes of spatiotemporal patterns, and explored the quantitative analysis of the influencing factors of geographic detector, and spatial correlation analysis. Results show that:(1)The Average Soil Erosion Modulus(ASEM)of Liupanshui was 23.50 t·hm~(-2)·a~(-1), with an average soil erosion amount of 1578.42*10~4 t·a~(-1). The micro and moderate erosion were the dominant erosion types, occupying 83.49% of the total area, while the strong and violent erosion accounted for only 5.3%. The strong erosion area in Liupanshui was mainly located at the junction of Beipanjiang River Basin and Nanpanjiang River Basin as well as the Karst areas with fragile eco-environment.(2)The ASEM was the largest in 2000, which increased by 5.50% compared with that in 1990. The ASEM in 2005 decreased by 18.2% compared with that in 2000. The ASEM in 2010 was the smallest, 11.4% lower than that in 2005. The ASEM in 2015 increased compared with that in 2010. The soil erosion intensity in Liupanshui city in 2000-2015 was weaker than that in 1990-2000. The area of violent erosion decreased, and the strong erosion shifted to micro, light and moderate erosion.(3)The vegetation coverage factor and the perennial average rainfall factor are important factors affecting the spatial distribution of regional soil erosion. Moreover, unused land, vegetation coverage less than 0.3, slope above 25° and rainfall between 1543~1593 mm are high-risk erosion areas.(4)Vegetation coverage and soil erosion have negative correlation in space, while rainfall factors have negative correlation and positive correlation in space.(5)Soil erosion improvement areas are mostly distributed in ecological engineering areas, so ecological engineering construction can improve soil erosion. Different ecological engineering protection priorities lead to different degree of soil erosion improvement. By simulating rainfall to calculate the soil erosion modulus and soil erosion amount before and after Grain-for-Green, it could be seen that the soil erosion situation in Liupanshui had improved after Grain-for-Green. Compared with cultivated land-forest land and cultivated land-grassland land use change area, Liupanshui city is more suitable to return cultivated land to forest. Implementation of the Grain-for-Green Project should be continued in Liupanshui city, and focus more on areas with complex topography and fragile eco-environment.", "abstract_ch": "六盘水市是我国生态地位极其重要,水土流失又较为严重的城市。近些年,六盘水市实施了一系列生态工程,为了定量分析六盘水市土壤侵蚀状况及其影响因素,本文基于RUSLE模型,利用降雨数据、遥感影像数据、土地利用数据等,对贵州省六盘水市1990-2015年土壤侵蚀模数和土壤侵蚀量进行定量模拟,分析其时空动态变化,利用地理探测器定量分析影响因素,并进行空间相关性分析,结果表明:① 六盘水市土壤侵蚀以微度和中度侵蚀为主。土壤侵蚀严重地区主要分布在北盘江流域与南盘江流域交界处以及喀斯特山地地区,煤矿开采使植被覆盖等抑制土壤侵蚀因子减少作用,使局部地区土壤侵蚀程度加剧。② 1990-2010年平均土壤侵蚀模数整体为下降趋势,2010-2015年为上升趋势。其中2000年平均土壤侵蚀模数最大,2010年平均土壤侵蚀模数最小。该变化由降雨可蚀性因子和植被覆盖度因子综合影响所致。③ 植被覆盖度因子和多年平均降雨量因子是影响区域土壤侵蚀空间分布的重要因素。未利用土地、植被覆盖度小于0.3、坡度在25°以上和降雨量在1543~1593 mm之间的地区为高风险侵蚀区域。④ 植被覆盖度与土壤侵蚀在空间上全部呈负相关性,降雨因子与土壤侵蚀在空间上存在负相关性和正相关性。⑤ 土壤侵蚀改善区域大多分布在生态工程区域内,生态工程建设能够改善土壤侵蚀情况,不同生态工程保护侧重点不同导致土壤侵蚀改善程度不同。退耕还林还草工程对六盘水市土壤侵蚀的改善具有重要意义,六盘水市更宜退耕还林。", "keywords_en": "soil erosion; spatiotemporal variations; RUSLE model; Geodetector; Liupanshui", "keywords_ch": "土壤侵蚀; 时空变化; RUSLE模型; 地理探测器; 六盘水市", "address_en": "Niu Li'nan,Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences;;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Key Laboratory of Terrestrial Surface Pattern and Simulation;;, ;;, Beijing;;Beijing 100101;;100049.Liu Guobo,Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences;;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Key Laboratory of Terrestrial Surface Pattern and Simulation;;, ;;, Beijing;;Beijing 100101;;100049.Tang Yuzhi,Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences;;University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Key Laboratory of Terrestrial Surface Pattern and Simulation;;, ;;, Beijing;;Beijing 100101;;100049.Shao Quanqin,Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Key Laboratory of Terrestrial Surface Pattern and Simulation, Beijing 100101, China.", "address_ch": "牛丽楠,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所;;中国科学院大学, 中国科学院陆地表层格局与模拟重点实验室;;, ;;, 北京;;北京 100101;;100049, 中国.刘国波,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所;;中国科学院大学, 中国科学院陆地表层格局与模拟重点实验室;;, ;;, 北京;;北京 100101;;100049, 中国.唐玉芝,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所;;中国科学院大学, 中国科学院陆地表层格局与模拟重点实验室;;, ;;, 北京;;北京 100101;;100049, 中国.邵全琴,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院陆地表层格局与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.", "research_areas": "Agriculture", "wos_categories": ""}

But the CO_2 footprint of residential buildings had a tendency of fluctuating drop. The construction development degree, energy structure and tertiary industry proportion were the three main influencing factors of construction CO_2 footprint. Thus, reducing consumption of building materials, especially steel and cement, reducing the proportion of coal consumption during construction and construction operation,and implementing limits of energy consumption and CO_2 emission on public buildings are the main technical directions of energy-saving and CO_2 reduction in construction.", "abstract_ch": "基于PB-LCA方法,以湖南省为例构建了省区层面的宏观建筑碳足迹模型,定量测度和比较20042016年建筑各个阶段的碳足迹及其变化情况,采用地理探测器技术分析了建筑碳足迹的影响机理。分析表明:建筑碳足迹整体上呈现波动增长之势,建材准备和建筑运行是产生碳足迹的两个主要阶段,而建造施工和建筑拆除阶段的碳足迹比重则较小;建材准备阶段的碳足迹主要来自钢材和水泥,公共建筑碳足迹处于波动上升的趋势,而居住建筑碳足迹则出现波动式下降之势;建筑业发展度、能源结构和第三产业比重是建筑碳足迹的3个主要影响因素。提出了减少建材特别是钢材和水泥的消耗量、降低建造施工和建筑运行阶段的煤炭类消费比重、实行公共建筑能耗和碳排放限额等3个建筑节能减碳的主要技术方向。", "keywords_en": "PB-LCA method; construction CO_2 footprint; geographical detector technology; Hunan province", "keywords_ch": "PB-LCA方法; 建筑碳足迹; 地理探测器技术; 湖南省", "address_en": "Zhang Wang,College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Hunan University of Technology;;Research Base for Green Industry and Low Carbon Development of City in Hunan Province, ;;, Zhuzhou;;Zhuzhou, ;; 412007;;412007.", "address_ch": "张旺,湖南工业大学城市与环境学院;;湖南省绿色工业与城市低碳发展研究基地, ;;, 株洲;;株洲, ;; 412007;;412007.", "research_areas": "Architecture", "wos_categories": ""}

Then we concentrated on the relationships between water conservation-soil erosion and net primary production (NPP) -soil erosion. In the different environmental factor gradients and geomorphological types, the spatial trade-off of ecosystem services and its differentiation characteristics were studied. The gradient analysis of the environmental factors shows that the spatial trade-off between water conservation and soil erosion decreases with the increase of vegetation coverage while the spatial trade-off between NPP and soil erosion increases with elevation and slope. The spatial trade-off in the middle elevation areas above 1000 meters and steep slope areas is 4-6 times higher than that in low elevation and gentle slope areas. The statistical results of the morphological geomorphology types area show that the geomorphological characteristics have macro-control effects on the spatial trade-off relationship between ecosystem services,and the spatial trade-off between NPP and soil erosion increases with the increase of topographic relief. Their ranking are as follows: the middle elevation plain < middle elevation terrace < middle elevation hill < small relief mountain < middle relief mountain,while the trend between water conservation and soil erosion is opposite.

Our results showed that the vegetation cover was in good condition, the coverage area was of medium height, and there was more than 94% of high height vegetation. The spatiotemporal change in vegetation cover was significant from 2000- 2015; the transformation of the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) was manifested as the transformation of NDVI > 0.4, and the cover area of medium and high height vegetation had a significant decreasing and increasing trend, respectively. The vegetation cover was better in the western and northern Sichuan plateau, while it was poor in the central urban areas of the Sichuan Basin and the Panxi area.

The response characteristics of scale and the spatial differentiation mechanism of the ecological service value are worth discussing. Taking the Dabie Mountain area located in central China as the research object, based on the data of land use classification, this paper applied the methods of spatial statistics, hot spot analysis and geographical detector to examine the dynamic evolution characteristics, scale effect and spatial differentiation mechanism of the ecological service value of Dabie Mountain area from 1970 to 2015. The results show that over the 50 years, the overall value of ecological services in the Dabie Mountain area increased by 951 million yuan, while in recent years it decreased by 395 million yuan, accounting for 41.54% of the total value added. Scale is helpful for understanding the pattern and process of ecosystem. To strengthen the study of scale characteristics in the evaluation of ecosystem service function can improve the objectivity, credibility and practicability of the evaluation results. Therefore, in this paper, we made a comparative analysis through the scale of four types, which includes 9- level amplitude. The results show that the unit scale of township is the characteristic scale of the spatial differentiation of ecological service value in Dabie Mountain area, and the spatial difference information of the ecological service value at the township unit scale is rich, and the type of township unit scale is a more appropriate research scale level in the study area. To strengthen the geographical exploration of the spatial differentiation of ecosystem service value will be helpful to carry out regional ecological planning and ecosystem regulation. In this study, we analyzed the spatial differentiation mechanism of ecosystem service value in Dabie Mountain area by using the geographical detector. The results show that the explanatory power q value of the ecological land use proportion, land use degree and human influence composite index among the 16 influencing factors contributing to the spatial differentiation of ecological service value is nearly 40%, which is the main reason for the spatial differentiation. Elevation and slope factor q value is nearly 30%, which is a secondary factor. There are mainly three categories and 30 types of interaction combinations with an interactive detection q value of more than 50%.

The coupling model between two systems is extended to five subsystems of human settlements. The entropy method and GIS spatial analysis methods are used to analyze the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of coupling coordination degree of human settlements system in Liaoning Province from 2005 to 2016. The research shows that: 1) From 2005 to 2016, the coupling degree and coupling coordination degree of the human settlements system in Liaoning Province showed a slow upward trend. There is a difference in the degree of coordination between cities. The high value areas of coupling coordination degree includes Shenyang and Dalian. The median area of coupling coordination degree includes Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Dandong, Jinzhou, Yingkou, Liaoyang, Panjin, Tieling, Chaoyang and Huludao. The coupling coordination degree low value area includes Fuxin. 2) The coupling coordination degree of human settlements in Liaoning Province is in a dispersed pattern which presents aroof ridgepattern and adual-core structurethat decrease from the middle to the sides. In the east-west direction, the spatial evolution trend gradually evolves from the inverted theUshape to the-shape, and the north-south direction changes from the tilted line type to theLtype. The coupling coordination degree between Shenyang and Dalian has been in the top two, far higher than other cities, as a dual core to lead the coordinated development of the human settlements system in Liaoning Province. 3) There are five types of zones: medium coupling-low coordination zone, medium coupling-transition coordination degree zone, high coupling-low coordination degree zone, high coupling-transition coordination degree zone and high coupling-high coordination degree zone. 4) We use geographic detector to explore the driving forces of the coupiling coordination within the human settlements system. The spatial differentiation driving force mainly includes people's needs, economic development, housing and internet development. People's needs are the basis for the coordinated development of the human settlements system. Economic development is the main driving force, and housing is a tool for coordinated development. However, the development of the Internet is a new driving force for the coordinated development of the human settlements system.", "abstract_ch": "人居环境系统内部的耦合协调是保证人居环境均衡发展的基础。基于人类-居住-支撑-自然-社会5个子系统,构建人居环境系统耦合协调发展评价指标体系,将2个系统间的容量耦合模型扩展运用到人居环境5个子系统中,综合熵值法、GIS空间分析以及地理探测器对辽宁省2005~2016年人居环境系统耦合协调度的时空演化特征与驱动力进行探讨,阐述人居环境系统内部协调性。研究表明:① 2005~2016年辽宁省人居环境系统内部的耦合度与耦合协调度整体呈缓慢浮动上升趋势;②辽宁省人居环境耦合协调度呈分散格局,并且呈现从中间向两侧递减的屋脊式格局和双核结构;东西方向上,空间演变趋势由倒U型逐渐向一字型演变,南北方向上由斜线型向L型演变。③全省出现了中耦合低协调区、中耦合过渡协调区、高耦合低协调区、高耦合过渡协调区、高耦合高协调区5种类型区。④空间分异驱动力主要包括人的需求、经济发展、住房、互联网发展等。", "keywords_en": "urban human settlements; coupling coordination degree; analysis of trend surface; spatio-temporal pattern evolution; Liaoning Province", "keywords_ch": "城市人居环境; 耦合协调度; 趋势面分析; 时空演化; 辽宁省", "address_en": "Li Xueming,School of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Liaoning Normal University;;Centre for Marine Economy and Sustainable Development Research,Liaoning Normal University, ;;, Dalian;;Dalian, Liaoning;;Liaoning 116029;;116029.Guo Yujie,School of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, Liaoning 116029, China.Tian Shenzhen,School of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, Liaoning 116029, China.Bai Zhizhen,School of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, Liaoning 116029, China.Liu He,School of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, Liaoning 116029, China.", "address_ch": "李雪铭,辽宁师范大学城市与环境学院;;辽宁师范大学海洋经济与可持续发展研究中心, ;;, 大连;;大连, 辽宁;;辽宁 116029;;116029, 中国.郭玉洁,辽宁师范大学城市与环境学院, 大连, 辽宁 116029, 中国.田深圳,辽宁师范大学城市与环境学院, 大连, 辽宁 116029, 中国.白芝珍,辽宁师范大学城市与环境学院, 大连, 辽宁 116029, 中国.刘贺,辽宁师范大学城市与环境学院, 大连, 辽宁 116029, 中国.", "research_areas": "Geography", "wos_categories": ""}

Basic variables including latitude, longitude, elevation, and the day of the year are used in the air temperature models. In addition to the basic variables, the relative humidity models use air temperature and ozone concentration as covariates, and the wind speed models use wind speed coarse-resolution reanalysis data as covariates. In our spatiotemporal models, spatial coordinates capture the spatial variation and time index of the day captures the time variation. Compared with GAM, residual network significantly improved the prediction accuracy: on average, CV (Cross Validation) R2of the three meteorological factors increased by 0.21, CV RMSE decreased by 37%, and the relative humidity model improved the most (CV R2: 0.85 vs. 0.52, CV RMSE: 7.53% vs. 13.59%).

Thus, against the background of a changing climate, the climate- vegetation relationship is a hot topic in current global change research. Using geodetector, this study integrated climatic factors (e.g., average temperature, precipitation, water vapor pressure, humidity, sunshine hours, standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index), topographic factors (e.g., slope and elevation), and anthropogenic factors to determine the dominant factors that influenced the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the Beijing- Tianjin- Hebei region from 2006 to 2015.

This study revealed the temporal and spatial pattern of vegetation, and the response of vegetation to climate and non- climate factors over the past 10 years, and provided a reference for the construction and restoration of ecological engineering. Trend analysis showed that the NDVI increased during this period, albeit with differences on different spatial scales. In montane regions, the NDVI increased more rapidly than in plains, terraces, and hills. In different vegetation-covered areas, the NDVI increased most rapidly in broadleaf forest, followed by shrubland and coniferous forest. Based on the results of the quantitative distribution analysis, at the temporal scale of one year, precipitation was the dominant factor driving NDVI and explained 39.4% of the spatial distribution, while the interaction of rainfall and land use was the dominant interaction factor, with a q value of 0.582. We observed seasonal and regional differences in the response of NDVI to climatic factors. In the four seasons, vapour pressure was the dominant factor for the spatial distribution of NDVI; humidity is the dominant factor in summer and autumn; and in winter, land use was the dominant factor for NDVI distribution. The explanatory power of the influencing factors on NDVI in the growing season differed in diverse geomorphological types. In montane areas, with increasing elevation, the q value of average temperature decreased. The explanatory power of impacting factors on NDVI of the growing season was different among diverse vegetation types. For different vegetation types, the explanatory power of precipitation on the spatial distribution of NDVI in the growing season was greater than that of mean temperature, with the q value ranked as following grassland > cultivated vegetation > shrubland > broadleaf forest >coniferous forest.

In addition, the selection of condition factors was not objective to such an extent that it may have reduced the reliability of LSM. To address these problems, a new method based on GeoDetector and a spatial logistic regression (SLR) model is proposed. GeoDetector is used to select condition factors based on the spatial distribution of landslides. The SLR model is used to make full use of the structural and attribute information of spatial objects simultaneously in LSM. The GeoDetector-SLR model is validated using data from the Duwen Highway Basin, which indudes the epicenter of the May 12, 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in southwestern China. Prediction accuracy of the GeoDetector-SLR model is found to be 86.1%, which is an 11.9% improvement over the traditional logistic regression model, indicating an improved and reliable solution for evaluating landslide susceptibility.

Serveral conclusions are drawn as follows: (1) Mixed use is the major form of street scale function elements distribution, from the perspective of concentration. All types of elements form a functional gathering area of specialization, but there are large differences between the degrees of specialization. The distribution of concentration of functional elements shows consistent trends with the overall quantity distribution. (2) The degrees of mixed use performance of coreperiphery spatial differences reflects that the degree of the core street area a is higher than that of the external zone. The degrees of mixed use of office, commerce, and leisure is stronger than their mixture degree with residence. (3) The main features of mixed use at street scale are the mixed multi- functions compatible with each other. Among the various types of functional elements, leisure and commercial elements have a higher degree of interaction with others, which means that they have a strong compatibility, with the positive effect on mixed use. (4) The spatial heterogeneity of the degrees of mixed use is significant. The primary determinants of the spatial distribution of mixed use include: land price, number of leisure elements and commercial elements.

In recent years, the number of cases of HFMD in China has increased rapidly, and has received increasing attention. Although there are many related studies, only a few studies focus on the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of HFMD incidence and quantify the association between meteorological factors, socioeconomic variables, and HFMD incidence. Geodetector and Bayesian space-time hierarchical models were applied to analyze the spatiotemporal heterogen-eity of the HFMD incidence from 2009 to 2013 within the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region. These were used to quantify the determinant power of meteorological factors, socioeconomic variables, and the interactions between two of these factors. The Geodetector method has the axiom that if an explanatory variable (x) determined an explained variable (y), the explained variable would exhibit a spatial distribution similar to that of the explanatory variable. This method has been widely used to measure the determinant power of potential explanatory variables. The Bayesian space-time hierarchical model has the potential to show the spatiotemporal variation of a geographic phenomenon. The results showed that: (1) the highest incidence of HFMD occurred in late spring and summer (May to July), and the lowest incidence occurred in winter (December to February). (2) Spatial heterogeneity existed. In particular high risks areas were mainly concentrated in areas of high economic development. The population density and proportion of the tertiary industry determinants, play a lead role in contributing to the spatial heterogeneity of HFMD incidence (q values of 0.35 and 0.28, respectively, as calculated by GeoDetector). (3) The main meteorological factors affecting the temporal heterogeneity of HFMD incidence were average temperature, cumulative precipitation, and relative humidity (with a determinant powers calculated by GeoDetector of 0.38, 0.27 and 0.13, respectively). Additionally, the interactions were greater than the independent effects between socioeconomic variables or meteorological factors. For example, the interaction of average temperature and relative humidity, average temperature and precipitation, average temperature and wind speed were 0.43, 0.40 and 0.42, respectively. The interaction of population density and proportion of the tertiary industry was 0.55. This result presented the strongest correlation with HFMD incidence.

A thorough understanding and quantitative identification of the influencing factors are essential for soil erosion protection and rocky desertification management. This study identifies the dominant factors (and interactions) influencing soil erosion and its spatiotemporal variability in a karst basin, the Sancha River Basin, China. The geographical detector method was used to conduct the quantitative attribution analysis, based on the modified universal soil loss equation model for karst environments. The results revealed that karst soil erosion exhibited a notable decreasing trend over the past 36 years (p < 0.01), decreasing from 16.70 t ha(-1) a(-1) in 1980 to 12.22 t ha(-1) a(-1) in 2015. The geographical detector results indicated significant differences in the strength of the association between influencing factors (or factor combinations) and karst soil erosion. Land use type was the dominant factor, followed by slope; a combination of land use type and slope was the dominant interaction factor, explaining at least 74% of the karst soil erosion distribution. Land use change dominated karst soil erosion dynamics in the 1980s and 1990s, and rainfall variability dominated in the 2000s. In addition, karst soil erosion showed high spatial heterogeneity, and the strength of the association differed substantially among diverse geomorphological types due to differences in the inner characteristics of each. These findings suggest that the characteristics of different geomorphological types should be considered for effective management and prevention of soil erosion at a regional level, and that steep croplands, especially with slopes higher than 15, should be prohibited in karst areas. The methodology and framework can be used to better understand the relationships between soil erosion and its influencing factors in karst areas.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Karst soil erosion;Quantitative attribution;Modified RUSLE;Geographical detector;Temporal dynamics;China;LAND-USE;ROCKY DESERTIFICATION;WATER EROSION;LOSS EQUATION;RUSLE;GIS;RUNOFF;MODEL;GEOMORPHOLOGY;PRECIPITATION", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Geology; Agriculture; Water Resources", "wos_categories": "Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Soil Science; Water Resources"}

Accordingly, the comprehensive characterization of the eutrophication status in terms of improved quantitative methods is valuable for local risk assessment and policy making. A novelty of this work is that the spatial distributions of chemical oxygen demand, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and dissolved inorganic phosphorus were estimated across space by the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) method. The BME estimates were found to have the best cross-validation performance compared to ordinary kriging and inverse distance weighted techniques. Based on the BME maps, it was found that about 25.95%, 19.18%, 20.53%, and 34.34% of these coastal waters were oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic, and hypereutrophic. Another novelty of the present work is that comprehensive stochastic site indicators (SSI) were introduced in the quantitative characterization of the eutrophication risk in the Zhejiang coastal waters under conditions of in situ uncertainty. The results showed that the level of the eutrophication index (EI) increased almost linearly with increasing threshold values; and that 71%, 51%, and 19% of coastal locations separated by various spatial lags experience considerable mesotrophic, eutrophic, and hypereutrophic risks, respectively. The average EI values over the subregions of the Zhejiang coastal waters graded as \"oligotrophic or higher,\" \"eutrophic or higher,\" and \"hypereutrophic\" were about 11.14, 14.28, and 25.34, respectively. Our results also revealed that the joint eutrophication strength between coastal locations in the Zhejiang region was consistently greater than the combined strength of independent eutrophications at these locations (we termed this situation \"positive quadrant eutrophication dependency\"). It was found that a critical eutrophication threshold zeta(cr) approximate to 8.38 exists so that below zeta(cr) the spatial eutrophication dependency in the Zhejiang coastal waters increases with zeta, whereas above zeta(cr) the opposite is true. Moreover, the eutrophication dependency decreases as the separation distance delta s increases. Interestingly, at distances delta s smaller than a critical distance delta s(cr) approximate to 15 km, the eutrophication locations are concentrated in the coastal waters of the Zhejiang province rather than being dispersed (this observation holds even for large thresholds zeta). Elasticity analysis of eutrophication indicators offered a quantitative measure of the excess eutrophication change in the Zhejiang coastal waters caused by a threshold change (the larger the elasticity is, the more sensitive eutrophication is to threshold changes). The above findings can contribute to an improved understanding of seawater quality and provide a practical approach for the identification of critical coastal water regions.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "YANGTZE-RIVER ESTUARY;RISK-ASSESSMENT;POLLUTION;NITROGEN;SYSTEMS;REGION;GULF;TIME", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Inst Isl & Coastal Ecosyst, Zhoushan, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Geochem, State Key Lab Organ Geochem, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China\n[ 4 ]‎ San Diego State Univ, Dept Geog, San Diego, CA 92182 USA", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography", "wos_categories": "Limnology; Oceanography"}

However, there are few historical fatal landslide catalogs available to quantitatively assess the impact as well as the temporal and spatial patterns of landslides. The Fatal Landslide Event Inventory of China (FLEIC), which spans from 1950 to 2016, was compiled based on multiple data sources. The inventory contains 1911 non-seismically triggered landslides, which resulted in a total of 28,139 deaths in China during 1950-2016. The occurrence frequency of fatal landslides presented significantly different trends for different grades of events. Very large fatal landslide events (fatalities > = 30) were on the rise during 1950-1999 and declined from 2000 to 2016. The decreasing trend after 2000 can be attributed to the increase in landslide mitigation investments. The small and medium-sized fatal landslide events (fatalities < 10) showed a significant increasing trend between 1950 and 2016, especially during the period of 2000-2016. This significant increasing trend is partly due to the improvement of the availability of landslide data online and may also be related to other factors including an increase in extreme precipitation events, the effects of land urbanization, and so on. This suggested that the inherent incompleteness of the landslide time series should be considered when analyzing. The fatal landslides mainly occurred between April and September (82.15%), which is consistent with the monthly precipitation variation in China. Spatially, most of the fatal landslides occurred in 14 provinces: five southwestern provinces (Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Chongqing), five southeastern provinces (Hunan, Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang), Shaanxi and Shanxi, Hubei and Gansu.

Records of more than 60000 FFDs are examined, and the centroid comparison method is used to reveal the spatiotemporal evolution of FFDs from 1951 to 2015. In particular, the geographical locations of the centroids, degrees of aggregation, and associated movement tendencies are examined to conduct a preliminary analysis of correlations between rainfall, population, and the spatiotemporal evolution of FFDs. Subsequently, using relevant data from 2000 to 2015, three factors relating to FFDs in natural watershed units include namely rainfall, human activity, and the environment of the Earth's surface. The geographical detector method is then employed to explore the effect of these driving factors on the spatial distribution of FFDs. Analysis results show that displacement of the spatial distribution of FFDs since 1949 is correlated with variations in rainfall and population distribution. In addition, it is determined that the distribution of FFDs occurring between 2000 and 2015 have regional differentiation characteristics. However, the effect of rainfall on the distribution of FFDs is more significant than that of human activity or the environment of the Earth's surface, but interactions occur between these latter two factors in disaster-formative environments. Furthermore, results also show that the driving factors of FFDs have significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity.

Each risk might be influenced by multiple environmental factors and the factors' interaction within the specific system. Hence, health risk assessments of heavy metal contamination must consider multiple environmental media and their transfer processes from one medium to another. Integrated assessments provide a new perspective for evaluating many factors, such as the potential ecological risks of soils, sediments, plants, and the transportation of heavy metals in these media, which influences the health risks. In this study, the main influencing factors for human health risk from heavy metals along the Yangtze River in Nanjing, Southeast China, were explored. The contents of five heavy metals were measured in sediment-soil-plant, including cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and chromium (Cr). The Cd displayed the highest potential ecological risk in soils and sediments, as it possessed high bioaccessibility (BA; 0.17 +/- 0.211) and bioaccumulation factor (BCF; 0.35 +/- 0.33). The 5.97% of the target hazard quotient (THQ) of Cd were higher than 1, indicating a potential health risk in plant consumption. Based on the geodetector model, determinant power (DP) valves for factors influencing health risk strongly suggest that plant types (0.479) has a highest effect, followed by soil organic matter (SOM; 0.292), and the BA of heavy metals (0.107). The results also indicate that pollution from the upper reaches of the river, and agricultural activities, had a greater impact on health risk than did industrial activities in the study area. Thus, regular monitoring and source control for Cd, along with integrated agricultural management practices should be implemented to control and reduce heavy metal inputs and improve the safety of cultivated plants.

The results show that soil erosion was most severe in areas with an elevation of 1200-1800m and intense anthropogenic activity.

The results showed that the average value of crop production increased substantially between 2000 and 2010, whereas the net primary productivity decreased significantly, and the water retention and soil conservation decreased slightly. The ecosystem services exhibited a spatial similar to that of influencing factors, and the combination of any two factors strengthened the spatial effect more than a single factor. The geomorphic factors (elevation and slope) were found to control the distribution of NPP, water retention, and soil conservation. The population density was responsible for crop production.

The performance of road pavement infrastructure is sophisticated and affected by numerous factors and varies greatly across different roads. Large scale spatial analysis for assessing road infrastructure performance is increasingly required for road management, therefore multi-source factors, including satellite remotely sensed climate and environmental data, and ground-monitored vehicles observations, are collected as explanatory variables. Different from the traditional point or area based geospatial attributes, the performance of pavement infrastructure is the line segment based spatial data. Thus, a segment-based spatial stratified heterogeneity method is utilized to explore the comprehensive impacts of vehicles, climate, properties of road and socioeconomic conditions on pavement infrastructure performance. Segment-based optimal discretization is applied on discretizing segment-based pavement data, and a segment-based geographical detector is utilized to assess the spatial impacts of variables and their interactions. Results show that the segment-based methods can more reasonably and accurately describe the characteristics of line segment based spatial data and assess the spatial associations. The two major categories of factors associated with pavement damage are the variables of traffic vehicles and heavy vehicles in particular, and climate and environmental conditions. Meanwhile, the interactions between the explanatory variables in these two categories have much more influence than the single explanatory variables, and the interactions can explain more than half of the pavement damage. This study highlights the great potential of remote sensing based large scale spatial analysis of road infrastructures.

Here, we adopted the modified Geographical Detector tool to investigate the main drivers of carbon emission from the perspective of stratified heterogeneity. The results of this analysis showed that human economic activities in China were the dominant effect of carbon emission changes, while energy intensity contributed toward controlling the carbon emission in China. Furthermore, population growth was the most significant driving force followed by energy intensity toward controlling the carbon emission of the USA. All these factors are mutually enhancing in changing carbon emissions, while oil share with energy intensity and coal share were more significantly enhanced in China's carbon emission than other interactions. The factors of human activities and energy mix posed a more powerful effect when they mutually enhanced each other to change carbon emission compared to other enhancing interactions.

The Computer Program to Calculate Emissions from Road Transport (COPERT) model from European Environment Agency (EEA) was introduced to estimate the 24-h NOx emission pattern of road segments with the parameters extracted from Didi massive trajectory data. Then, the temporal Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) Clustering was used to classify road segments based on the 24-h emission rates, while Geographical Detector and MORAN's I were introduced to verify the impact of built environment on line source emissions and the similarity of emissions generated from the nearby road segments. As a result, the spatial autoregressive moving average (SARMA) regression model was incorporated to assess the impact of selected built environment factors on the road segment emission rate based on the probabilistic results from FCM. It was found that short road length, being close to city center, high density of bus stations, more ramps nearby and high proportion of residential or commercial land would substantially increase the emission rate. Finally, the 24-h atmospheric NO2 concentrations were obtained from the environmental monitor stations, to calculate the time variational trend by comparing with the line source traffic emissions, which to some extent explains the contribution of on-road traffic to the overall atmospheric pollution.

The study analyzes the traffic volume spatiotemporal distributions and built environment influence factors determined by the geographical detector. An improved gravity model using simple structural parameters (lanes number and road length) is proposed to estimate the traffic flows of day and peak hour scales for specific flow ranges.Results: The results show that the peak hours of different intersections and roads are heterogeneous and reveal trip time flexibility. The correlation between peak hour flows and day flows is significant in the multidimensional analysis. Based on the investigation of lanes, more interesting conclusions are found. In this case, when the numbers of lanes of intersections and roads are more than 14 and 4 respectively, the lane resources are wasted to a great extent. There is also a certain correlation between these factors. Proposed gravity model establishes the connection between structure and function of urban roads.Conclusions: Flexible work time and places will be effective methods to reduce traffic congestion. The day flows could be estimated via a traffic survey on peak hour flows, especially in developing cities. The traffic flow mainly concentrates in a relatively small part of city roads.

In addition to pollutant emissions and meteorological conditions, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is also influenced by socioeconomic development. Thus, identifying the potential effects of socioeconomic development on PM2.5 variations can provide insights into particulate pollution control. This study applied spatial regression and the geographical detector technique for assessing the directions and strength of association between socioeconomic factors and PM2.5 concentrations, using data collected from 945 monitoring stations in 190 Chinese cities in 2014. The results indicated that the annual average PM2.5 concentrations is 61 +/- 20 mu g/m(3), and cites with more than 75 mu g/m(3) were mainly located in North China, especially in Tianjin and Hebei province. We also identified a marked seasonal variation in concentrations levels, with the highest level in winter due to coal consumption, lower temperatures, and less rainfall than in summer. Monthly variations followed a \"U-shaped\" pattern, with a down trend from January and an inflection point in September and then an increasing trend from October. The results of spatial regression indicated that population density, industrial structure, industrial soot (dust) emissions, and road density have a significantly positive effect on PM2.5 concentrations, with a significantly negative influence exerted only by economic growth. In addition, trade openness and electricity consumption were found to have no significant impact on PM2.5 concentrations. Using the geographical detector technique, the strength of association between the five significant drivers and PM2.5 concentrations was further analyzed. We found notable differences among the variables, with industrial soot (dust) emissions playing a greater role in the PM2.5 concentrations than the other variables.

However, the approach has rarely been used to comprehensively analyze the individual and interactive influences of anthropogenic factors (e. g., population density, impervious surface percentage) and ecological factors (e. g., canopy density, stand age, and elevation) on PM2.5 concentrations. To do this, we used Landsat-8 images and meteorological data to retrieve quantitative data on the concentrations of particulates (PM2.5), then integrated a forest management planning inventory (FMPI), population density distribution data, meteorological data, and topographic data in a Geographic Information System database, and applied a spatial statistical analysis model to identify aggregated areas (hot spots and cold spots) of particulates in the urban area of Jinjiang city, China. A geographical detector model was used to analyze the individual and interactive influences of anthropogenic and ecological factors on PM2.5 concentrations. We found that particulate concentration hot spots are mainly distributed in urban centers and suburbs, while cold spots are mainly distributed in the suburbs and exurban region. Elevation was the dominant individual factor affecting PM2.5 concentrations, followed by dominant tree species and meteorological factors.

Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is a critical tool for preventing or mitigating the negative impacts of landslides. Although many previous studies have employed various statistical methods to produce quantitative maps of the landslide susceptibility index (LSI) based on inventories of past landslides and contributing factors, they are mostly ad hoc to a specific area and their success has been hindered by the lack of a methodology that could produce the right mapping units at proper scale and by the lack of a general framework for objectively accounting for the differing contribution of various preparatory factors. This paper addresses these issues by integrating the geomorphon and geographical detector methods into LSM to improve its performance. The geomorphon method, an innovative pattern recognition approach for identifying landform elements based on the line of sight concept, is adapted to delineate ridge lines and valley lines to form slope units at self-adjusted spatial scale suitable for LSM. The geographical detector method, a spatial variance analysis method, is integrated to objectively assign the weights of contributing factors for LSM. Applying the new integrated approach to I-Lan, Taiwan produced very significant improvement in LSI mapping performance than a previous model, especially in highly susceptible areas. The new method offers a general framework for better mapping landslide susceptibility and mitigating its negative impacts.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Landslide susceptibility mapping;Geomorphon;Geographical detector;Slope units;Frequency ratio;Weights;LOGISTIC-REGRESSION MODELS;REMOTE-SENSING DATA;LAND-USE CHANGE;STATISTICAL-MODELS;HAZARD ASSESSMENT;FREQUENCY RATIO;RISK-ASSESSMENT;AREA;CHINA;CLASSIFICATION", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Geog, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA\n[ 2 ]‎ Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Global Earth Observat & Data Anal Ctr, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan, Taiwan", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Engineering; Geology", "wos_categories": "Engineering, Geological; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary"}

Mortality to extreme temperatures (MoET) was recognized to vary geographically, either by countries within a region or by areas within a country. However, so far, little attention has been paid to rural residents, with even lesser attention on the potential rural-urban differences. The aim of our study was to offer a quite comprehensive analysis on the differences in temperature-mortality relationship between rural and urban areas across China.Method: A distributed lag nonlinear model was built to describe the temperature-mortality relationship, based on the mortality data and meteorological variable of 75 communities in China from 2007 to 2012. Subsequently, a meta-analysis was applied to compare the differences in the temperature-mortality relationship between rural and urban areas at various levels.Results: Distinct responses regarding MoET between rural and urban areas were observed at different spatial scales. At regional level, more U-shaped curves were observed for temperature-mortality relationships in urban areas, while more J-shaped curves were observed in rural areas. At national scale, we found that the cold effect was stronger in rural areas (RR: rural 1.69 vs. urban 1.51), while heat effect was stronger in urban areas (RR: rural 1.01 vs. urban 1.12). Moreover, the modifying influence of air pollution on temperature-mortality relationship was found to be very limited.Conclusion: The difference in response of MoET between rural and urban areas was noticeable, cold effect is more significant in China both in rural and urban areas. Additionally, urban areas in southern China and rural areas in northern China suffered more from extreme temperature events. Our findings suggest that differences in rural-urban responses to MoET should be taken seriously when intervention measures for reducing the risks to residents' health were adopted.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Extreme temperature;Public health;Difference between rural and urban areas;China;Air pollution effect;PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION;POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS;HEAT WAVES;CLIMATE-CHANGE;GUANGDONG PROVINCE;POPULATION HEALTH;LAND-USE;IMPACT;RISK;CITIES", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Natl Ctr Chron & Noncommunicable Dis Control & Pr, Beijing 100050, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Hangzhou Normal Univ, Inst Remote Sensing & Earth Sci, 1378 Wenyi West St, Hangzhou 311121, Zhejiang, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health", "wos_categories": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"}

Hotspots of landslide-generated casualties were in the western Sichuan mountainous area and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau region, southeast hilly area, northern part of the loess hilly area, and Tianshan and Qilian Mountains. However, local distribution patterns indicated that landslide casualty events were also influenced by economic activity factors. To quantitatively analyse the influence of natural environment and human-economic activity factors, the Probability Model for Landslide Casualty Events in China (LCEC) was built based on logistic regression analysis. The results showed that relative relief, GDP growth rate, mean annual precipitation, fault zones, and population density were positively correlated with casualties caused by landslides. Notably, GDP growth rate ranked only second to relative relief as the primary factors in the probability of casualties due to landslides. The occurrence probability of a landslide casualty event increased 2.706 times with a GDP growth rate increase of 2.72%. In contrast, vegetation coverage was negatively correlated with casualties caused by landslides. The LCEC model was then applied to calculate the occurrence probability of landslide casualty events for each county in China. The results showed that there are 27 counties with high occurrence probability but zero casualty events.

Many methods for calculating such associations have been proposed, but the case when both variables are categorical is underdeveloped despite the fact that many datasets of interest are in the form of either regionalizations or thematic maps. In this paper, we advance this case by adapting the so-called V-measure method from its original information-theoretical formulation to the analysis of variance formulation which provides more insight for spatial analysis. We present a step-by-step derivation of the V-measure from the perspective of the analysis of variance. The method produces three indices of global association and two sets of local association indicators which could be mapped to indicate spatial distribution of association strength. The open-source software for calculating all indices from vector datasets accompanies the paper. To showcase the utility of the V-measure, we identified three different application contexts: comparative, associative, and derivative, and present an example of each of them. The V-measure method has several advantages over the widely used Mapcurves method, it has clear interpretations in terms of mutual information as well as in terms of analysis of variance, it provides more precise assessment of association, it is ready-to-use through the accompanying software, and the examples given in the paper serves as a guide to the gamut of its possible applications.

China is an agricultural country with a large but poor rural population. At the village level, poverty alleviation has the potential to affect millions of citizens. The Loess Plateau is a composite of fragile ecological environment and rural poverty communities. As a backward economy often twins with fragile ecology, studying poverty from a multidimensional perspective in tandem with spatial heterogeneity and its influencing factors can provide an effective analysis of poverty in regions with characteristics similar to those of the Loess Plateau. This study features Pengyang, which is a poverty-stricken county located on the Loess Plateau, and relies on the approach by Alkire and Foster to measure multidimensional poverty, using spatial autocorrelation, Geodetector, OLSR and quantile regression (QR) analysis. Results from our investigation show that the study area has a deep level of multidimensional poverty, with a Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) score of 0.045. The rates of health, housing, and education dimensions were 0.263, 0.245, and 0.227, respectively. Moran's I of MPI was 0.2, which indicates that multidimensional poverty was positively correlated with a spatial pattern of \"north, south, middle; high, high, low\". Using Geodetector, the mean distance between villages and the center of town, as well as the mean elevation of the villages and mean distance to a river, were found to be the main factors of spatial heterogeneity within the MPI. The q-values of them were 0.552, 0.396, and 0.326, respectively, and the result of regression analysis conforms to the Geodetector. The interaction of the above factors enabled the creation of a multidimensional poverty spatial heterogeneity mechanism at village level for the Loess Plateau, revealing a lack in welfare of farmers, the poor of infrastructure, the congenital deficiency and stalled development of industry, and weak government functioning at the township level. Our results suggest that new strategies regarding urbanization should be investigated in order to improve and ensure the quality of public services in areas with similar characteristic as the Loess Plateau. These new strategies could enable the resolution of problems from the root, such as designing public goods and services that fill gaps in current health care and housing options, as well as the operation of transport facilities at the village level. This could help to mitigate welfare loss of farmers as well as reduce the negative impact of health, housing, education, and other dimensions of poverty.", "abstract_ch": "黄土高原属于生态环境脆弱与农村经济贫困的复合区域,研究其村域多维贫困及空间异质性有助揭示乡村贫困原因及空间格局。以宁夏彭阳县为研究区,运用A-F法对村域多维贫困进行测度,并结合空间自相关、地理探测器和回归分析方法对其空间异质性进行了系统分析。结果表明:①研究区农户多维贫困程度较深,K= 3时,多维贫困指数(MPI)为0.045,平均剥夺份额0.361,主要致贫维度是住房、健康和教育,贡献率分别为0.263、0.245、0.227,收入维度贡献率仅占0.130;② MPI空间自相关Moran's I值为0.2,即存在正相关,呈现南北高,中部低的格局;③地理探测器结果显示行政村到镇中心的距离、村平均高程、村委会到主要河流的距离是影响MPI空间异质性的主要因子,其决定力q值分别为0.552、0.396、0.326,且在最小二乘线性回归(OLSR)和分位数回归(QR)中均通过了1%的显著性检验;④各因子间的相互作用形成了黄土高原农户福利缺失、基础设施落后与产业发展受阻、乡镇政府职能被削弱的村域多维贫困空间分异机制。⑤最后提出推进新型城镇化建设,实现公共服务均等化,从根源上解决农村医疗、住房、交通设施落后等难题的建议。", "keywords_en": "multidimensional poverty; spatial heterogeneity; Geodetector; quantile regression; Loess Plateau", "keywords_ch": "多维贫困; 空间异质性; 地理探测器; 分位数回归; 黄土高原", "address_en": "Wen Qi,School of Resources and Environment, Ningxia University;;Key Laboratory (China-Arab) of Resource Evaluation and Environmental Regulation of Arid Region in Ningxia, ;;Key Laboratory (China-Arab) of Resource Evaluation and Environmental Regulation of Arid Region in Ningxia, Yinchuan;;Yinchuan, ;; 750021;;750021.Shi Linna,School of Resources and Environment, Ningxia University;;Key Laboratory (China-Arab) of Resource Evaluation and Environmental Regulation of Arid Region in Ningxia, ;;Key Laboratory (China-Arab) of Resource Evaluation and Environmental Regulation of Arid Region in Ningxia, Yinchuan;;Yinchuan, ;; 750021;;750021.Ma Caihong,School of Resources and Environment, Ningxia University;;Key Laboratory (China-Arab) of Resource Evaluation and Environmental Regulation of Arid Region in Ningxia, ;;Key Laboratory (China-Arab) of Resource Evaluation and Environmental Regulation of Arid Region in Ningxia, Yinchuan;;Yinchuan, ;; 750021;;750021.Wang Yongsheng,Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.", "address_ch": "文琦,宁夏大学资源环境学院;;宁夏(中阿)旱区资源评价与环境调控重点实验室, ;;宁夏(中阿)旱区资源评价与环境调控重点实验室, 银川;;银川, ;; 750021;;750021.施琳娜,宁夏大学资源环境学院;;宁夏(中阿)旱区资源评价与环境调控重点实验室, ;;宁夏(中阿)旱区资源评价与环境调控重点实验室, 银川;;银川, ;; 750021;;750021.马彩虹,宁夏大学资源环境学院;;宁夏(中阿)旱区资源评价与环境调控重点实验室, ;;宁夏(中阿)旱区资源评价与环境调控重点实验室, 银川;;银川, ;; 750021;;750021.王永生,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 北京 100101, 中国.", "research_areas": "Agriculture", "wos_categories": ""}

(3) Spatial statistics (1970s- 1980s): Including systematic research on spatial autocorrelation, and the analysis of spatial point data, lattice data, and spatial continuous data. (4) Maturation and diffusion (1990s- 2000s): With the help of computer, geographical information system (GIS) and spatial data collection technology, an in- depth study was conducted on large spatial databases and the spatial heterogeneity. It includes spatial data mining (SDM), e.g., GeoMiner, and local spatial statistics such as local indicators of spatial autocorrelation (LISA), geographical weighted regression (GWR), spatial scan statistics, and GeoDetector.

The results showed that: 1) The change regularity of landscape pattern indices showed that the degree of landscape fragmentation increased firstly and then decreased from 1990 to 2014. To be specific, Edge Density(ED) and Shannon's Diversity Index(SHDI) of the watershed showed the trend of increase firstly and then decrease, which indicated that the landscape of the watershed developed from irregularity to regularity in edge shape and the diversity of landscape types enhanced firstly and then weakened. Contagion Index(CONTAG) of the watershed showed the situation of decreased firstly and then increased, which suggested that reunion degree of different patch types changed from weak to strong, the higher the CONTAG, the better connectivity, otherwise, there were more small patches, representing higher fragmentation. Landscape Division Index (DIVISION) showed a slight downward trend. 2) In general, landscape fragmentation is affected by human activities, and counties or districts scale can better reflect human activities. The scale analysis of counties or districts showed that the degree of landscape fragmentation increased dramatically in Wenxian and Wudu during 1990-2002 and decreased significantly in Wenxian during 2002-2014.3) Landscape fragmentation degree of the southeastern watershed (mainly in Wenxian and Wudu) enhanced firstly and then weakened and the variation tendency was most intense and complicated. 4) Taking 2014 as an example, this article explored the driving factors of landscape fragmentation based on GeoDetector. The outcome of ecological detector deemed that there were striking differences between land use types and elevation, slope, and aspect, and so did human activities intensity, nevertheless, land use types and human activities intensity had no difference, which illustrated that human disturbance (i.e. land use types and human activities intensity) and topographic factors (i.e. elevation, slope and aspect) had different effects on the spatial differentiation of landscape fragmentation. Moreover, the result of factor detector showed that human disturbance had the highest ability to explain the spatial differentiation of landscape fragmentation which meant human interference was the momentous driving factor. Finally, the result of interaction detector showed that the interaction between human activities intensity and elevation had the strongest influence on landscape fragmentation, followed by the interaction with land use types.

However, studies on the multifactor synthesis are still insufficient. In this study, the simulation of soil erosion and its quantitative attribution analysis have been conducted in different morphological types of geomorphology in a typical karst basin based on the RUSLE model and the geographical detector method. The influencing factors, such as land use type, slope, rainfall, elevation, lithology and vegetation cover, have been taken into consideration. Results show that the strength of association between the six influencing factors and soil erosion was notably different in various morphological types of geomorphology. Land use type and slope were the dominant factors of soil erosion in the Sancha River Basin, especially for land use type whose power of determinant (q value) for soil erosion was much higher than that of other factors. The q value of slope declined with the increase of relief in mountainous areas, namely it was ranked as follows: middle elevation hill > small relief mountain > middle relief mountain. Multi-factor interactions were proven to significantly strengthen soil erosion, particularly for the combination of land use type with slope, which can explain 70% of soil erosion distribution. It can be found that soil erosion in the same land use type with different slopes (such as dry land with a slope of 5°and dry land with slopes above 25°) or in the diverse land use types with the same slopes (such as dry land with a slope of 5° and forest with a slope of 5°), varied greatly. This indicates that prohibiting steep slope cultivation and the Grain for Green Project are reasonable measures to harness soil erosion in karst areas. Based on statistics of soil erosion difference between diverse stratifications of each influencing factor, results of risk detector suggest that the amount of stratification combinations with significant difference accounted for 55% at least in small and middle relief mountains.

Also in this period, rural development has become more pluralistic and more externally dependent and the driving factors are more pluralistic as well. Therefore, a more comprehensive and systematic spatial interface perspective was applied to explore the spatial differentiation of rurality in village areas, which provides a new perspective for the study of rural development in the new era. In this study, we used the rurality index to analyze the spatial differentiation of rurality at the village scale in Gongyi City, Henan Province, China. Next, we quantitatively determined the location of spatial interfaces in Gongyi using the moving split-window technique. Finally, we used a geographical detector technique to assess the mechanisms that influenced the spatial differentiation of rurality at the village scale in Gongyi. Our results show the following: (1) The spatial interface of Gongyi can be divided into natural and human categories. The most important natural interfaces include terrain and natural resources, and the human interfaces include agricultural production, residential, administrative division, and traffic. (2) The distribution of rurality at the village scale in Gongyi showed strong positive spatial autocorrelation. The number of the strong rurality and extremely strong rurality villages was relatively small. The strong rurality and extremely strong rurality villages were mainly distributed in the southern and northwestern regions of Gongyi City. Intermediate rurality villages were mainly distributed in the southwestern, southeastern, and eastern regions of Gongyi City. The weak rurality and extremely weak rurality villages were mainly distributed around the urban region and the two port towns in the west and east of the city. On the whole, spatial agglomeration was evident and it was strong in the periphery and weak in the middle area. (3) Under the influence of the multiple effects of the spatial interfaces, the elements in the county space of Gongyi were reorganized to promote the formation of rurality spatial differentiation. The traffic, administrative division, and residential interfaces strongly affected rurality spatial differentiation, while the natural interfaces played a less important role.", "abstract_ch": "新时期中国乡村正在经历新一轮剧烈的转型重构过程,而村域乡村性空间分异可视为乡村转型重构过程在地方上的具体表现;由于乡村发展的多元性和外向性特征显著,其发展动力也变得更加多元,因此采用更加综合和系统的空间界面视角探索村域乡村性空间分异,可为新时期乡村发展问题的研究提供新的视角。本文以村域经济数据以及土地利用类型数据为基础,集成乡村性指数评价、游动分割窗以及地理探测器等技术手段,对巩义市村域尺度乡村性空间分异进行分析,并对其空间界面的位置和影响范围进行定量识别与判断,在此基础上探讨了村域尺度乡村性空间分异机理。结果表明:①巩义市空间界面主要分为自然界面、人文界面两大类,其中自然界面又分为地形界面和自然资源界面;人文界面主要由农业生产界面、居住界面、行政界面和交通界面组成。②乡村性空间分布呈现较强的正空间自相关性,并且呈现出边缘强、中间弱的分布格局。③空间界面具有的多重效应在一定程度上推动县域要素的空间重组,促使巩义市乡村性空间分异的形成。其中,人文界面中的交通界面、行政界面和居住界面对乡村性空间分异影响较大,而自然界面影响较小。", "keywords_en": "spatial interface; rurality; spatial differentiation mechanism; village scale; Gongyi City; Henan", "keywords_ch": "空间界面; 乡村性; 空间分异机理; 村域尺度; 巩义市; 河南省", "address_en": "Han Dong,College of Environment and Planning, Key Research Institute of Yellow River Civilization and Sustainable Development, Research Center of Regional Development and Planning, Henan University, Kaifeng, He'nan 475001.Qiao Jiajun,College of Environment and Planning, Key Research Institute of Yellow River Civilization and Sustainable Development, Research Center of Regional Development and Planning, Henan University, Kaifeng, He'nan 475001.Ma Yuling,College of Environment and Planning, Key Research Institute of Yellow River Civilization and Sustainable Development, Research Center of Regional Development and Planning, Henan University, Kaifeng, He'nan 475001.", "address_ch": "韩冬,河南大学环境与规划学院/黄河文明与可持续发展研究中心/区域发展与规划研究中心, 开封, 河南 475001, 中国.乔家君,河南大学环境与规划学院/黄河文明与可持续发展研究中心/区域发展与规划研究中心, 开封, 河南 475001, 中国.马玉玲,河南大学环境与规划学院/黄河文明与可持续发展研究中心/区域发展与规划研究中心, 开封, 河南 475001, 中国.", "research_areas": "Agriculture", "wos_categories": ""}

However, the limitation of sensors leads to a serious saturation problem in the NTL data,especially in the city center area of high light intensity. Saturated nighttime light data cover the differences and details of light intensity in the central area of a city and reduce the application scenarios of DMSP/OLS data.The method for alleviating the saturation of light data is mainly divided into radiometric calibration and non-radiometric calibration. Although the radiometric calibration method achieves high precision, the complex calibration algorithm and interference factors lead to a low data output rate. The non-radiometric calibration method uses auxiliary data(including natural factors, social indicators, and economic indicators) to construct the function model and thereby establish correct saturation data. We use GeoDetector to identify the factors of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index(NDVI), Enhancel Vegetation Index(EVI), and Unit Network Length(UNL) and propose the unit network length-adjusted(UNLI) NTL Index after quantifying the explanatory power of stable light data. Furthermore, we evaluated the capabilities of EANTLI and UNLI to eliminate saturation through the \"detailed description of the degree of light intensity in the saturation area,\" \"correlation analysis of UNLI, EANTLI, and(RCNTL) radiometric calibration data,\" and \"goodness of fit of power consumption and GDP\". Both UNLI and EANTLI yield good results in the modified saturation data,but UNLI achieves greater accuracy in describing the difference in the light intensities of the saturation area. UNLI can break through the limitations of spatial resolution and increase the intensity of light detail differences. In terms of the light of the highest intensity saturation region, UNLI is closely correlated with RCNTL. However, with the decrease of light intensity, the linear regression coefficient R~2 of the UNLIEANTLI and RCNTL gradually approached, and the fitting advantages of UNLI and RCNTL is lost. In the fitting analysis of power consumption and GDP, the piecewise calibration model of \"EANTLI&UNLI\" can maximize the advantages of EVI and UNL, which has the best fitting effect(adjusted R~2=0.873). In this study, we proposed a new method to correct the saturation of night light data. The new method can effectively eliminate the saturation of native NTL in urban central areas.

Evaluating the spatiotemporal variations that result from land use changes can therefore provide the scientific basis for regional ecological protection and land management. Thus, taking Yuzhong County as a case study, which is located in the transitional area of the Three Natural Zones, this paper examines the spatiotemporal characteristics of habitat quality and its evolution over the period between 1995 and 2015 based on coefficient of variation and Taylor index. Choosing 14 explanatory variables, such as rainfall, distance to the county center, and area of land remediation, this paper explores by means of geographic detector analysis the factors that influence habitat quality and its evolution across a range of different spatial levels. The results of this analysis reveal that, in the first place, habitat quality throughout the whole county has remained stable and has improved slightly over the last 20 years. However, due to variations in natural and socioeconomic conditions, internal changes in habitat quality within the three sub-regions considered in this study are different from one another, consistent with an overall decrease along a south-north transect. Secondly, the differences in habitat quality between the three regions, as compared to the differences within them, have tended to decrease over time. Over the period of this analysis, variations in habitat quality continued to increase on the Loess Plateau in the north, declined continuously in the Middle Plain Area, and initially descended then ascended in the Southern Mountain Area. Thirdly, geographic scale is an important component that must be considered for evaluating habitat quality changes, as factors and mechanisms vary at different levels. Natural environmental variables play a fundamental role in habitat quality changes; on the other hand, the effect of socioeconomic variables on habitat quality has become weaker over time, whereas the effect of policy variables has become greater. Furthermore, synergism occurs amongst the different factors. Considering the importance of different policies based on different geographical scales, this paper proposes relevant policy suggestions for optimizing habitat quality within comparable areas.", "abstract_ch": "以地处三大自然区过渡地带的榆中县为案例,分析了1995-2015年县域及内部分区生境质量演变的时空特征,借助地理探测器模型分析并探索了生境质量影响因素及其机制。结果表明:①全县生境质量变化保持稳定并略有提升,县域内部生境质量变化呈现出由南向北递减的三级梯度特征;②全县生境质量的地带间与地带内差异均趋于缩小,北部黄土高原区持续加大,中部平原区连续下降,南部山区则先缩小后增大;③全县及县域内部的影响因素及机制因为地理尺度的差异而不同。自然环境变量对生境质量变化发挥着基础和关键性的作用,社会经济变量呈现出减小的态势,而政策调控变量对生境质量的影响则越来越大,各因子间的协同增强效应推动了生境质量的变化。", "keywords_en": "the transition area of Three Natural Zones; habitat quality; spatial and temporal difference; influencing factors; mechanism", "keywords_ch": "三大自然区过渡带; 生境质量; 时空差异; 影响因素; 机制", "address_en": "Liu Chunfang,Geography and Environment College of Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730070, China.Wang Chuan,Geography and Environment College of Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730070, China.Liu Licheng,Geography and Environment College of Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730070, China.", "address_ch": "刘春芳,西北师范大学地理与环境科学学院, 兰州, 甘肃 730070, 中国.王川,西北师范大学地理与环境科学学院, 兰州, 甘肃 730070, 中国.刘立程,西北师范大学地理与环境科学学院, 兰州, 甘肃 730070, 中国.", "research_areas": "Environmental Sciences & Ecology", "wos_categories": ""}

Based on the cluster analysis method, China is divided into 8 regions in order to study the regional differences of the surface radiation products of the ECMWF reanalysis data in China. Taking into account the influence of atmospheric factors on the earth's surface radiation and the spatial stratified heterogeneity of the atmospheric distribution, the geographical detector is used to find the causes of errors in different sites of reanalysis data.?Overall, ECMWF is higher than the ground observation station data and the monthly deviation is 18.2835W/m~2. ECMWF shows seasonal difference, greater deviation in spring and winter, less deviation in summer and autumn. Large relative deviation of the data mainly distributed in December, January, February and March while minor relative deviation of the data mainly concentrated in July, June, August and September. The dominant atmospheric factors in different regions are different in winter and summer. In summer, from zone 1 to 5 the dominant factors are aerosols and the power of determinant is larger. The dominant factors of the zone 6 are albedo and aerosol.

Therefore, the location of the northern boundary of China's tropical zone has been one of the most controversial issues in the study of comprehensive physical regionalisation in China. This paper introduces developments in the study of the northern boundary of China's tropical zone, in which different scholars delimit the boundary with great differences based on different regionalisation objectives, indexes, and methods. The main divergence of opinion is found in different understandings of zonal vegetation, agricultural vegetation type, cropping systems, tropical soil type and tropical characteristics. In this study, we applied the GeoDetector model, which measures the spatial stratified heterogeneity, to validate the northern boundaries of the tropical zone delimited by six principal scholars. The results show that the mean q-statistic value of the higher latitude boundary delimited by Ren Mei'e is the largest (q=0.37), suggesting that, of the rival views, it best reflects the regional differences between China's tropical and subtropical zones, but it is not necessarily suitable for guiding the development of tropical agriculture. The mean values of the q-statistics of Zheng Du's line and Yu Xianfang's line around the Leizhou Peninsula at a lower latitude were smaller, at 0.10 and 0.08 respectively, indicating that the regional differences were smaller than those of Ren Mei'e's boundary.

To resolve such problems, this paper provides an additional sampling layout optimization method that initially develops a classification error index by building a multi-Gaussian model with the predicted values and error variances of unsampled locations and then calculates the probability of a threshold value occurring in the standardized Gaussian distribution. The average error indexes of all locations in the study area are then set as the objectivity function of the additional sampling layout optimization, and the spatial simulated annealing is adopted to obtain the optimized sampling layout by minimizing the objectivity function. The performance of the error index sampling layout optimization method was demonstrated in a case study using chromium concentration data for HunanProvince, China.

Petroleum and metal cities demonstrated the most resistance, whereas coal cities performed the worst. Second, the influential factors affecting economic resilience varied across the two economic cycles, but location advantage, research and development (R and D) intensity, foreign trade dependence ratio, and supporting policies had positive effects on resilience during both economic cycles, while the proportion of employed persons in resource industries had a negative effect. Industrial diversity had a weak and ambiguous effect on resilience.

In this study we provided a perspective analysis of the changes of residential land prices in 2008, 2011 and 2014 based on the land price monitoring records of 105 cities and then conducted a geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis on the relationships between residential land price and three major impact factors (i.e., immigrant population, gross domestic product (GDP) and investment in residential buildings). Results show that the areas in which GDP had relatively strong positive impacts on residential land price expanded with time. The negative effects of immigrant population on residential land price were mainly concentrated in the cities around the Bohai Rim and the area with negative effects gradually shrank in the three studied years. Conversely, the areas with negative correlation between investment in residential buildings and residential land price gradually expanded in size over time. A geographical detector was used to examine the relative importance of factors to residential land price. It was found that the GDP had more significant influence on residential land price than other factors and the influence of the three factors to overall variation in residential land price increased over the three studied years.

This study proposes a novel unsupervised evaluation method to quantitatively measure the quality of segmentation results to overcome these problems. In this method, multiple spectral and spatial features of images are first extracted simultaneously and then integrated into a feature set to improve the quality of the feature representation of ground objects. The indicators designed for spatial stratified heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation are included to estimate the properties of the segments in this integrated feature set. These two indicators are then combined into a global assessment metric as the final quality score. The trade-offs of the combined indicators are accounted for using a strategy based on the Mahalanobis distance, which can be exhibited geometrically. The method is tested on two segmentation algorithms and three testing images. The proposed method is compared with two existing unsupervised methods and a supervised method to confirm its capabilities.

The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban region is the biggest urban agglomeration in northern China, and it is one of the areas in the country that is most heavily infected with bacillary dysentery. The objective of the study was to analyze the spatial-temporal pattern and to determine any contributory risk factors on the bacillary dysentery.Methods: Bacillary dysentery case data from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012 in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei were employed. GeoDetector method was used to determine the impact of potential risk factors, and to identify regions and seasons at high risk of the disease.Results: There were 36,472 cases of bacillary dysentery in 2012 in the study region. The incidence of bacillary dysentery varies widely amongst different age groups; the higher incidence of bacillary dysentery mainly occurs in the population under the age of five. Bacillary dysentery presents apparent seasonal variance, with the highest incidence occurring from June to September. In terms of the potential meteorological risk factors, mean temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, mean wind speed and sunshine hours explain the time variant of bacillary dysentery at 83%, 31%, 25%, 17% and 13%, respectively. The interactive effect between temperature and humidity has an explanatory power of 87%, indicating that a hot and humid environment is more likely to lead to the occurrence of bacillary dysentery. Socio-economic factors affect the spatial distribution of bacillary dysentery. The top four factors are age group, per capita GDP, population density and rural population proportion, and their determinant powers are 61%, 27%, 25% and 21%, respectively. The interactive effect between age group and the other factors accounts for more than 60% of bacillary dysentery transmission.Conclusions: Bacillary dysentery poses a higher risk in the population of children. It is affected by meteorological and socio-economic factors, and it is necessary to pay more attention to the meteorological period and situation, particularly in period with high temperature and humidity, as well as places in urban areas with high population density, and a low proportion of rural population.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Bacillary dysentery;Meteorological factors;Socio-economic factors;Spatial-temporal;GeoDetector model;METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS;TEMPERATURE;VARIABLES;DISEASES;PATTERN;REGION;COUNTY;IMPACT", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Changan Univ, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ China Natl Ctr Food Safety Risk Assessment, Beijing, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health", "wos_categories": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"}

Results: Four clusters of dengue fever were identified in Guangzhou in 2014, including one hot spot in the central area of Guangzhou and three cold spots in the suburban districts. For individual effects, the temperature (q = 0.33) was the dominant factor of dengue fever, followed by precipitation (q = 0.24), road density (q = 0.24), and water body area (q = 0.23). For the interactive effects, the combination of high precipitation, high temperature, and high road density might result in increased dengue fever incidence.

Transmission of the disease is usually associated with multiple biological characteristics and social factors but also factors can play a role. Few studies have assessed the exact and interactive influence of each factor promoting schistosomiasis transmission.Methods: We used a series of different detectors (i.e., specific detector, risk detector, ecological detector and interaction detector) to evaluate separate and interactive effects of the environmental factors on schistosomiasis prevalence. Specifically, (i) specific detector quantifies the impact of a risk factor on an observed spatial disease pattern, which were ranked statistically by a value of Power of Determinate (PD) calculation; (ii) risk detector detects high risk areas of a disease on the condition that the study area is stratified by a potential risk factor; (iii) ecological detector explores whether a risk factor is more significant than another in controlling the spatial pattern of a disease; (iv) interaction detector probes whether two risk factors when taken together weaken or enhance one another, or whether they are independent in developing a disease. Infection data of schistosomiasis based on conventional surveys were obtained at the county level from the health authorities in Anhui Province, China and used in combination with information from Chinese weather stations and internationally available environmental data.Results: The specific detector identified various factors of potential importance as follows: Proximity to Yangtze River (0.322) > Land cover (0.285) > sunshine hours (0.256) > population density (0.109) > altitude (0.090) > the normalized different vegetation index (NDVI) (0.077) > land surface temperature at daytime (LSTday) (0.007). The risk detector indicated that areas of schistosomiasis high risk were located within a buffer distance of 50 km from Yangtze River. The ecological detector disclosed that the factors investigated have significantly different effects. The interaction detector revealed that interaction between the factors enhanced their main effects in most cases.Conclusion: Proximity to Yangtze River had the strongest effect on schistosomiasis prevalence followed by land cover and sunshine hours, while the remaining factors had only weak influence. Interaction between factors played an even more important role in influencing schistosomiasis prevalence than each factor on its own.

Concentrations of critical As and Cd, and the associated exposed CRs are closed to the safe thresholds after remediating the risk areas identified by the integrated H-G scheme.

In this paper, ECE data from 143 countries from 1990 to 2014 were selected to analyze regional differences in ECE growth rates by using the coefficient of variation. Then a geographical detector was used to analyze the key determinant factors on ECE growth rates around the world and in eight types of regions. The results show that: (1) the ECE growth rate in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) region is low and tended to decrease, while in the non-OECD region it is high and tended to increase; (2) the coefficient of variation and detection factor of ECE growth rates at a regional scale are higher than those at a global scale; (3) in terms of the key determinant factors, population growth rate, growth rate of per capita GDP, and energy intensity growth rate are the three key determinant factors of ECE growth rates in the OECD region and most of the non-OECD regions such as non-OECD European and Eurasian (NO-EE), Asia (NO-AS), non-OECD Americas (NO-AM). The key determinant factors in the African (NO-AF) region are population growth rates and natural gas carbon intensity growth rates. The key determinant factors of the Middle East (NO-ME) are population growth rate, coal carbon intensity growth rate and per capita GDP growth rate; (4) the determinant power of the detection factor, the population growth rate at the global scale and regional scale is the strongest, showing a significant spatial consistency. The determinant power of per capita GDP growth rate and energy intensity growth rate in the OECD region, respectively, rank second and third, also showing a spatial consistency.

Therefore, the OECD region should continue to reduce the growth of energy intensity, and develop alternative energy resources in the future, while those that are plagued by carbon emissions in non-OECD regions should pay more attention to the positive influence of lower population growth rates on reducing the growth rate of energy-related CO2 emissions.

Pairs of LULC type factors were found to enhance each other to increase the air pollution concentrations, so were pairs of landscape factors. Meteorological factors were found to reinforce the control of air pollution of LULC type factors as well as landscape factors significantly. In view of the above considerations, we draw the conclusion that the spatial patterns of air pollution probed were closely related to land factors, either in LULC or landscape metrics.

On the basis of results obtained using Moran's I, the study revealed the presence of significant spatial autocorrelation (or spatial agglomeration) in the data. Using spatial regression techniques, the study identifies the positive effect exerted by the proportion of renters, floating population, wage level, the cost of land, the housing market and city service level on housing prices, and the negative influence exerted by living space. The geographical detector technique revealed marked differences in the relative influence, as well as the strength of association, of the seven factors in relation to housing prices. The cost of land had a greater influence on housing prices than other factors.

Significant associations of the infection with chicken and goose densities, but not with duck density, were identified after adjusting for spatial clustering effects of the H7N9 cases across multiple geographic scales of neighborhood, community, district and city levels. These exposure risks varied geographically in association with proximity to rivers and lakes that were also proxies for inapparent exposure to avian-related environment.

The study showed that: 1) there was an explicit and regular change over time on use of community parks; 2) the use of the community parks appeared to intensify at the central and northeastern part of the parks; 3) among the four external factors, the accessibility on foot was the most relevant to the use of community parks; influence of population density and business and office facilities on the use of community parks cannot be ignored; however, impact of accessibility by car on the use of community parks was not significant.

A dataset of Chengdu housing prices and selected public service factors were constructed for the year 2016, and geographical detector technique was adopted in this study. The results indicate that the average housing price was 8480 yuan/m~2 in Chengdu in 2016, and it showed a progressive decrease from the city center to the suburbs between the traffic circles and along the radial arteries, forming the circular and radial patterns. In general, housing prices were high in the western and southern parts while low in the eastern and north parts of the city. The impact of public service provision (mainly health care, financing, and education services) on housing prices was most pronounced in the third circular zone and southwest of the downtown area, where it was higher than the overall impact in Chengdu downtown areas. The impact of public services on housing prices was significantly affected by the difference of spatial functions in different zones. Differences in public service provision and spatial functions will further deepen the differentiation pattern of housing prices, and promote the overheating of local property prices.

Urban agglomeration is an advanced form of urbanization that encompasses the spatial organization of cities within a specific geographical area, and in which the process of aging differs from that in other regions. Based on county- specific data from population surveys in 2000 and 2010,we determined the spatial patterns and variations of aging populations in 20 urban agglomerations in China using geographical detector-based and coefficient of variation methods. We also examined the contributing factors of population aging variability. Results demonstrated that in 2000,older people accounted for 7.32% of the urban agglomeration demographic structure, with 12 of the 20 urban agglomerations defined as adult- type populations. In 2010,however, older people accounted for 9.00% of the urban agglomeration demographic structure and, except for those in the Pearl River Delta and Ningxia areas along the Yellow River, all the urban agglomerations entered the elderly population stage. Moreover, high-age and moderately high-age regions expanded towards inland urban agglomerations, with population aging increasing obviously and population type changing from adult to aging. In addition, significant regional differences in the incremental increases in the number of older people and growth rates of the aging populations existed in the urban agglomerations. Low-age and high- age regions had smaller increments and growth rates, whereas moderately low- age, mid-age, and moderately high-age regions had greater increments and growth rates, indicating a declining aging rate in the order of regional, national, and local urban agglomerations. Within each urban agglomeration, the distribution pattern of aging showed the coexistence of uplift and collapse. The distribution pattern of aging within national urban agglomerations changed from an increasing to collapsing structure, and population aging in central China reduced. Conversely, regional urban agglomerations changed from a homogeneous to an increasing structure, and population aging in the central region increased. Population aging of urban agglomerations was the result of internal and external factors, with changes in base period aging, population age structure, and population fluidity being the predominant factors. Universal uplift of the population age structure was a key factor affecting aging and population types in urban agglomerations. Furthermore, low- age population immigration into urban agglomerations had a \"diluting effect\" on population aging, and aggregation and diffusion effects caused by different development stages of urban agglomeration played important roles in aging and population migration.", "abstract_ch": "老龄化和城市化是当今世界面临的两大人口问题。城市群是城市发展到成熟阶段的空间组织形态,是老龄化的特殊区域。本文基于2000年和2010年全国人口普查分县数据,综合应用地理探测器和变异系数等方法,清晰地刻画了中国20个城市群人口老龄化的空间格局及其变化特征,审视了人口老龄化变化的影响因素。结果表明:①2000年中国城市群人口老龄化平均水平为7.32%,其中12个城市群的人口属于成年型,到2010年时人口老龄化平均水平已上升为9.00%,除珠三角与宁夏沿黄城市群外,其余18个城市群均步入了老年型人口,表现出明显的水平升级与类型替变态势。②老龄化高值、较高值区域不断向内陆城市群跃迁。③城市群老龄化的增量和增速存在显著的区域差异,老龄化水平的低值区和高值区增量少、增速慢,而较低值、中值和较高值区增量多、增速快。总体上表现出区域性城市群国家级城市群地区性城市群老龄化速度递减的态势。④在城市群内部,老龄化分布格局表现出隆升一塌缩并存的现象。国家级城市群内部老龄化分布格局从隆升结构向塌缩结构转变,城市群中心区人口老龄化水平降低;而地区性城市群和区域性城市群内部老龄化分布格局则从均质结构向隆升结构转变,中心区人口老龄化水平上升。⑤城市群人口老龄化是内外因素综合影响的结果,基期老龄化程度、人口年龄结构替变和人口流动性是主导性因素。其中人口年龄结构的普遍性抬升是城市群老龄化升级与类型替变的关键,低龄人口迁入到城市群对人口老龄化则起到稀释作用,城市群发育阶段不同引致的聚集和扩散效应对老龄化则起到诱导作用。", "keywords_en": "urban agglomeration; population ageing; spatial- temporal patterns; influencing factors; geographical detector tool; China", "keywords_ch": "城市群; 人口老龄化; 时空格局; 影响因素; 地理探测器; 中国", "address_en": "Wang Lucang,College of Geography and Environment Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730070, China.Li Wei,College of Geography and Environment Science, Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730070, China.Wu Rongwei,Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, CAS, Urumqi, Xinjiang 830011, China.", "address_ch": "王录仓,西北师范大学地理与环境科学学院, 兰州, 甘肃 730070, 中国.李巍,西北师范大学地理与环境科学学院, 兰州, 甘肃 730070, 中国.武荣伟,中国科学院新疆生态与地理研究所, 乌鲁木齐, 新疆 830011, 中国.", "research_areas": "Science & Technology - Other Topics", "wos_categories": ""}

In addition, it relates to the public health and radiation environment safety. The evaluation methods of spatial distribution level are mostly based on expert experience knowledge, which cannot explicitly express the quantitative relationship between the gamma Radiation dose rate and the environmental factors. In order to understand the spatial distribution and the influencing mechanism of gamma Radiation dose rate, we proposed a new evaluation method of revealing the environmental influence mechanism of gamma Radiation dose rate, based on geographical detector (Geogdetector). A total of 6 environmental factors were selected for the evaluation of spatial distribution of gamma Radiation dose rate, including the elevation, ecology, topography, climate, vegetation, and LUCC. Firstly, we collected the data of automatic monitoring station of national radiation environment in 2015, and calculated the annual average value in each city. Then, we studied the spatial distribution of gamma Radiation dose rate in 44 cities to discover the spatial pattern. Finally, we used the geographical detector to reveal the environmental influence mechanism of gamma radiation dose rate. The results show that: (1) the spatial distribution of gamma radiation dose rate in China has the following pattern: the low value distribute along the buffer zone from the city Heihe to Nanning, the high value distribute on both sides of the buffer zone. (2) The explanatory power of environmental factors is sorted into: Elevation (0.846)>Climate (0.741)>Vegetation (0.691)>LUCC(0.427)>Ecology (0.419)> Topography (0.101). On the one hand, the elevation works through the appearance of the geological structure to influence the crust in the natural radiation level. On the other hand, through the impact of the distribution of the natural environment, the elevation also determines the distribution of human activities, and the role of artificial ionizing radiation source.

Many previous studies have reported that human health risk is very sensitive to temperature and climate change was considered to be the most severe global health threat in the 21st century. Nowadays, the research on the impact of extreme temperature on public health has been a hotspot. Compared to those in developed countries, the related studies have started late in China. Moreover, there are three limitations in these studies. (1) Most of such studies focused only on one city or a few cities and the studies on the whole country are few.(2) The previous studies have not quantitatively identified the influence of temperature on health because the spatial scales were based on administrative regions, not on temperature zones. (3) Comparing with many studies on hot wave, relatively fewer are concerned with the influence of extreme low temperature. To overcome aforementioned problems, we collected the mortality dataset and meteorological variables of 127 communities in China during 2007 to 2012 from China Center for Disease Control and Prevention and pooled the community-specific cold risk in various latitude-effected temperature zones with the meta-analysis method. Then, we utilized the Distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) at community level to investigate temperature-mortality relationship in different temperature zones and calculated the relative risk (RR) of extreme low temperature on mortality. The results showed that although temperature-mortality curves at the community level appeared huge differences, the pooled curves were generally U-or J-shaped in these five zones. Temperature-mortality curves in three zones (the sub-temperate region, warm temperate region and north subtropical region) were all U-shaped, indicating both low and high temperatures could increase significantly mortality risk. Moreover, the curves appeared J-shaped in other two zones (the middle subtropical region and south subtropical region). The most significant cold effect was observed in middle subtropical, with a RR of 1.93 (95% CI: 1.08-3.60); while the cold effect in north subtropical was not so obvious, with a RR of 1.27 (95% CI: 0.94-1.72). Based on this, an M-shaped curve of the cold risk was found across Chinese mainland. This means the risks of cold-related mortality are high in warm temperature and middle subtropical zone, moderate in sub-temperate and south subtropical zone, and low in north subtropical zone. Low temperature does show significant impact on temperature-mortality risk, but considering the M-shaped risk curve, we believe social-economic factors should also be taken into consideration. To explain this phenomenon, we collected the social-economic data including population and GDP and found that the highest per capita GDP matched with the lowest cold-related risk, while the related lower per capita GDP matched with the highest cold-related risk. Based on these findings, different characteristics of mortality of cold stress highlighted that not only ambient temperature but also social-economic condition can be a main factor controlling health risk. Our findings also suggest that more adaptive and effective measures especially increasing investment on public health are necessary, especially for the middle subtropical zone, to reduce health risks in China.", "abstract_ch": "全球变暖导致气象灾害频发,尤其是极端天气事件。极端温度对公共健康的影响已成为当今研究的热点问题之一。相比于发达国家,中国在该领域研究起步较晚。虽然已有出色的成果,但在以下3个方面还略显不足:①大多数研究基于一个城市或几个城市,缺乏基于大量数据的区域尺度的研究;②已有研究往往按地理因素或行政单位来划分区域,而忽视区域内部温度的异质性;③相比高温热浪,鲜少有研究关注低温冷害的影响。针对上述问题,本文收集了中国疾病预防控制中心2007-2012年全国127个站点的数据,利用分布式滞后非线性模型,探究了中国5个温度带温度与居民非意外死亡之间的暴露-反应曲线。在此基础上,定义当地温度分布1%处的温度为极端低温,根据温度-死亡风险曲线,计算了冷害造成的死亡风险。结果表明,不同温度带的温度-死亡关系曲线呈现U型或J型。极端低温对北亚热带影响最小,其相对风险为1.27(95%CI: 0.94-1.72);对中亚热带影响最大,其相对风险为1.93(95%CI: 1.08-3.60)。随着温度带温度的升高,低温冷效应的影响呈现\"M\"型,这一特征与不同温度带经济发展有关。因此,不同地区的政府除了应着力提高地区经济发展外,还应根据地区特征,采取更积极有效的措施来应对低温冷害可能给当地公共健康造成的威胁。", "keywords_en": "temperature and public health; low temperature; DLNM model; climate change; spatial difference", "keywords_ch": "温度与公共健康; 低温; DLNM模型; 气候变化; 空间分异", "address_en": "Wang Chenzhi,State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resources Ecology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China.Zhang Zhao,State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resources Ecology, Beijing Normal University, Key Laboratory of Environmental Change and Natural Disaster, MOE, Beijing 100875, China.Zhou Maigeng,Surveillance Branch, National Center for Chronic and Non-communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, China.Yin Peng,Surveillance Branch, National Center for Chronic and Non-communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, China.Tao Fulu,Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Jin Yuexiong,Peoples Insurance Company of China Huzhou branch, Huzhou, Zhejiang 313000, China.", "address_ch": "王琛智,北京师范大学, 地表过程与资源生态国家重点实验室, 北京 100875, 中国.张朝,北京师范大学, 地表过程与资源生态国家重点实验室;;环境演变与自然灾害教育部重点实验室, 北京 100875, 中国.周脉耕,中国疾病预防控制中心慢性非传染性疾病预防控制中心, 北京 100050, 中国.殷鹏,中国疾病预防控制中心慢性非传染性疾病预防控制中心, 北京 100050, 中国.陶福禄,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 北京 100101, 中国.金月雄,中国人民财产保险股份有限公司湖州分公司, 湖州, 浙江 313000, 中国.", "research_areas": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health", "wos_categories": ""}

However, there is little quantitative research on the principles of rainfall index selection in the previous literatures. Based on the small watershed map (1:50,000 scale), the rainstorm atlas and the spatial distribution of mountain torrent disasters, this paper focused on the small watersheds in Wuyuan County in Jangxi Province and used GIS (Geographic Information System), Correlational Analysis, Spatial Cluster and Geographical Detector to obtain the rainfall indices which had great impact on the mountain torrent disasters of the small watersheds. The selected rainfall indices will take part in the hazard analysis of mountain torrent disasters in the study area. The conclusion is drawn as follows: (1) Seven uncorrelated rainfall indices have been obtained from the original 24 rainfall indices by the correlational analysis method. This means that in order to avoid the information overlap, we need to analyze the correlation between pairs of the rainfall indices before the hazard analysis of mountain torrent disaster. (2) By using the Optimized Hot Spot Analysis tool based on Local Getis-Ord Gi* Algorithm to get the estimated hazard values of the mountain torrent disasters of small watersheds, the calculation results are in line with the spatial distribution of mountain torrent disasters in this study area.

In this study, we selected 579 bulk commodity delivery warehouses in China in 2015 as the research object.Then we mainly used the softwares ArcGIS and OpenGeoDA to figure out the spatial distribution characteristics. We input the datebase into the ArcGIS software, and using join method to count the amount of the bulk commodity delivery warehouses in 31 provincial areas of China. Firstly we find that the amount of bulk commodity delivery warehouses is uneven distributed. Delivery warehouses are mainly located in southeast coastal area. Then we successively using research methods as Kernel density estimation, exploratory spatial analysis and geographical detector and so on. We find that there exist outstanding differences in the Kernel density estimation results. South Jiangsu Province, Shanghai, North Zhejiang, Guangdong Province, North Hebei, Tianjin and part of Shandong Province show high value in Kernel density, while the value in the provinces as Guangxi, Hubei, Liaoning, Henan is low and that the provinces of northwest area is extremely low. Thirdly, we adopt the spatial clustering method to estimate the distribution of bulk commodity delivery warehouses. Then the figures confirmed that it does have the characteristic of spatial agglomeration. Delivery warehouses are remarkably agglomerated in Anhui province, Zhejiang Province and Guangdong Province; Delivery warehouses distributed dispersedly in Hebei province, Shandong Province, Hubei Province, Jiangxi Province, Gansu Province and Sichuan Province. To find the most important factors which influence the distribution of the bulk commodity delivery warehouses, we choose geography detective model. We finally find that the Primary factors having impacts on spatial distribution of bulk commodity delivery warehouses are the level of regional economy and total volume of foreign trade; Agricultural output and GDP have less impact on the bulk commodity delivery warehouses distribution; especially, the distribution of resource has no influence on the distribution of the delivery warehouses. Based on the conclusions above, we recommended that our government should advance the planning skills and make the delivery warehouse development planning more reasonable.

In recent 40 years, a series of environmental and climatic issues such as degradation of Arctic natural environment, frequent extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere and global sea-level rise are caused by continuous warming and apparent sea ice decrease in Arctic. So it's important to know the extent, variation, trend of Arctic sea ice and its response to global climate change. The most commonly used datasets such as HadISST and OISST sea ice dataset provided long time series of changes in sea ice of the Arctic regions. However, the spatial resolution of these datasets is relatively low. There are some limits in the study of response of sea ice change in Arctic key regions to weather and climate in China. To overcome these problems and to make up the lack of passive microwave sea ice dataset provided by China, FY (Feng Yun) sea ice dataset is developed by NSMC (National Satellite Meteorological Center) on June 27th, 2011. In this dataset, the Enhanced NASA Team (NT2) algorithm is used based on the data of MWRI (Microwave Radiation Imager) sensor carried on FY satellite. In this algorithm, direct radiative transfer model is used to model MWRI brightness temperature for four surface types (ice-free ocean, new-formed ice, one-year ice and multi-years ice) and for different atmospheric conditions. Then, sea ice coverage lookup table (0% to 100% in 1% increments) is obtained based on modeled brightness temperature considering different atmospheric conditions. Sea ice coverage is confirmed by comparing observed value with modeled value. Sea ice extent is consistent with the actual situation in most Arctic regions. Although matching errors between channels and positioning errors have been corrected in FY dataset, the received echo signal is relatively weak due to the shorter antenna on MWRI. The weak echo signal makes it difficult to correctly differentiate the boundary between sea ice and near sea shore land, which greatly impact the total accuracy of the dataset and its application. In order to solve this problem, this study introduces a method of optimizing FY Arctic sea ice dataset based on NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Center) sea ice product. In NSIDC product, judgment matrix was created covering the entire grid and identifying each pixel as land, shore, near-shore, offshore or ocean as determined by the land/sea mask. Then, these different pixels are corrected in different degrees, respectively. Sea ice extent calculated from NSIDC product is strongly consistent to the actual situation. The accuracy of FY dataset is greatly improved. The analysis results indicated an extremely significantly positive correlation with the NSIDC product (R~2 = 0.9997) during June 27th, 2011-December 31st, 2015. The maximum deviation percent of daily, monthly and annually sea ice extent is 3.5%, 1.9% and 0.9%, respectively. Also, the optimization process of FY dataset has no obvious influence on the spatial stratified heterogeneity of the dataset. The optimized FY dataset can correctly reflect Arctic sea ice extent and its variation, especially in coastline regions. It can provide reliable basic data for the study of Arctic sea ice change.", "abstract_ch": "北极海冰对全球气候起着非常重要的调制作用,海冰范围是海冰监测的基本参数。近40年,北极地区持续变暖,北极海冰显著减少,进而引发北极自然环境恶化、北半球极端天气频发、全球海平面上升等一系列环境和气候问题。准确获取北极海冰范围及其演变趋势,确定海冰变化对全球气候系统的响应,是研究和预测全球气候变化趋势的关键之一。HasISST和OISST海冰数据集在海冰监测中应用最为广泛,可为北极地区长时间序列海冰变化研究提供基础数据,但这2套数据集空间分辨率相对较低,应用于北极关键区对中国气候响应研究方面存在很大的局限,为解决这一问题和弥补国内海冰监测微波遥感数据的空白,2011年6月27日,国家卫星气象中心(National Satellite Meteorological Center, NSMC)发布了FY(Fengyun, FY)北极海冰数据集,该数据集利用搭载在FY卫星上的微波成像仪(Microwave Radiation Imager, MWRI)数据,使用Enhance NASA Team算法制作,该算法利用前向辐射传输模型模拟北极地区4种海表类型(海水、新生冰、一年冰和多年冰)在不同大气条件下MWRI辐射亮温,进而得到每种大气条件下0~100%的海冰覆盖度查找表(海冰覆盖度每次增加1%),通过观测值与模拟值的比对得到海冰覆盖度,由该数据集计算得到的北极海冰范围在大部分区域与实际情况相符。该产品虽已进行通道间匹配误差修正和定位精度偏差订正,但由于其搭载的微波成像仪(Microwave Radiation Imager, MWRI)天线长度有限,造成传感器探测到的地物回波信号相对较弱,难以区分海冰和近岸附近的陆地,影响了该数据集的精度和应用。为解决这一问题,本文基于美国冰雪中心(National Snow and Ice Data Center, NSIDC)发布的海冰产品对FY海冰数据集进行优化,NSIDC产品利用判断矩阵对海岸线附近的像元进行识别,并对误差像元进行不同程度的修正,由NSIDC产品计算得到的北极海冰范围与实际情况更为符合。数据集优化大大提高了FY海冰数据集的精度,研究结果表明,优化后FY海冰数据集与NSIDC产品相关系数高达0.9997,且二者日、月、年平均最大海冰范围偏差仅为3.5%、1.9%、0.9%,且FY海冰数据集优化过程对其较好的空间分异特征无明显影响。该数据集可正确地反映北极海冰范围及其变化情况,且海岸线附近海冰的分布情况更准确,可为北极海冰变化研究提供可靠的基础数据。", "keywords_en": "sea ice dataset; FengYun(FY)-3B; remote sensing; Arctic; spatial stratified heterogeneity", "keywords_ch": "海冰数据集; 风云三号卫星; 遥感; 北极; 空间分异", "address_en": "Zhai Zhaokun,College of Geomatics, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Key Laboratory of Surveying and Mapping Technology on Island and Reef, State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping, Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, Qingdao, Shandong 266590, China.Lu Shanlong,Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, Beijing 100101, China.Wang Ping,College of Geomatics, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Key Laboratory of Surveying and Mapping Technology on Island and Reef, State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping, Qingdao, Shandong 266590, China.Ma Lijuan,National Climate Center, National Satellite Meteorological Center, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100081, China.Li Duo,National Climate Center, National Satellite Meteorological Center, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100081, China.Ren Yuyu,National Climate Center, National Satellite Meteorological Center, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100081, China.Wu Shengli,National Climate Center, National Satellite Meteorological Center, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100081, China.", "address_ch": "翟召坤,山东科技大学测绘科学与工程学院, 海岛(礁)测绘技术国家测绘地理信息局重点实验室;;中国科学院数字地球重点实验室;;遥感科学国家重点实验室, 青岛, 山东 266590, 中国.卢善龙,中国科学院遥感与数字地球研究所, 中国科学院数字地球重点实验室;;遥感科学国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.王萍,山东科技大学测绘科学与工程学院, 海岛(礁)测绘技术国家测绘地理信息局重点实验室, 青岛, 山东 266590, 中国.马丽娟,国家气候中心,国家卫星气象中心,中国气象局, 北京 100081, 中国.李多,国家气候中心,国家卫星气象中心,中国气象局, 北京 100081, 中国.任玉玉,国家气候中心,国家卫星气象中心,中国气象局, 北京 100081, 中国.武胜利,国家气候中心,国家卫星气象中心,中国气象局, 北京 100081, 中国.", "research_areas": "Oceanography", "wos_categories": ""}

By introducing demand index, medical institution scale, regional population and per capita disposable income, the equity of medical service system was evaluated using the Gini coefficient, spatial correlation and spatial stratified heterogeneity. It indicated that the distribution of medical institutions in Wuhan is reasonable from the aspect of population distribution. Medical institutions are mainly distributed in the area of dense population while the distribution of medical institutions is comparatively rare in suburban area.

Different from most previous research, this paper examined the differentiation and changes of population distribution on both sides of Hu Line from a perspective of spatial stratified heterogeneity instead. Geodetector was employed based on the spatial database of China's census data of 1953, 1982, 1990, 2000 and 2010 to reconfirm spatial position of Hu Line and analyzed changes of spatial stratified heterogeneity of population between southeast and northwest sides of Hu Line in different periods. Changes of population distribution since the founding of New China were found and the reasons for these changes were discussed. Major findings include: (1) From the spatial stratified heterogeneity perspective, Hu Line could be improved and optimized, at least, in some periods. Although the ratio of total population on both sides of Hu Line has roughly been kept at 94:6 since 1953, spatial stratified heterogeneity of population between the two sides (the southeastern side: the northwestern side) increased when Hu Line moves to south slightly in 1953, 2000 and 2010, which means population distribution was more homogeneous within either southeastern or northwestern region and heterogeneity was more remarkable between the two regions. (2) Heterogeneity decreased gradually since the reform and opening up. We found characteristics of population distribution converged on the two sides, especially since the 1990s when convergence between the two sides became apparent. This finding is significantly different from the conclusion of \"remain unchanged\" from most literatures. The reasons why heterogeneity reduced were: pattern of population distribution on the southeastern side changed from relatively even distribution among cities before 1990 to agglomeration in a few huge cities after 2000, while the degree of spatial agglomeration of population decreased slightly after the reform on the northwestern side. These changes have been confirmed by the analysis from cumulative distribution function and Gini coefficient. (3) On the whole, the effect of economic factors on population distribution has become more and more important, while the effect of natural environment and institution reduced. Combined effect from economic development, natural environment and institution resulted in two opposite directions of changes of population spatial distribution on the two sides. It should be emphasized that although general effect of natural environment has decreased, some natural factors, such as Three Gradient Terrains, still have significantly influence on population distribution in China.", "abstract_ch": "胡焕庸线作为人地关系的重要地理大发现之一,揭示了中国人口分布东密西疏的重要特征,是人文与经济地理学对社会的重要贡献之一。本文采用地理探测器等定量方法,以人口普查数据为基础,对胡焕庸线两侧人口分布的分异性特征进行了深入讨论,并尝试解释中国人口分布特征变化的原因及其机制。结果表明:①胡焕庸线作为中国最重要的人口分界线仍基本保持稳定,但从空间统计学分异特征来看该分界线仍可进一步优化调整;②胡焕庸线两侧内部人口集聚模式发生着明显变化,东南半壁人口分布由改革开放之前和初期的相对均衡状态,转变为以长三角、珠三角等少数区域为中心的集聚模式;而西北半壁人口分布的集聚程度则趋于下降;③从人口空间分布的影响因素看,尽管总体上,经济发展类因素对于人口空间分布影响不断增强,但三大阶梯等自然地理本底条件依然对中国人口分布有着重要影响。", "keywords_en": "Hu-Line; population distribution; spatial heterogeneity; agglomeration; dispersion; Geodetector", "keywords_ch": "胡焕庸线; 人口分布; 空间分异性; 集聚; 扩散; 地理探测器", "address_en": "Li Jiaming,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Lu Dadao,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Chen Mingxing,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Xu Chengdong,State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environment Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Li Yang,China Center for Modernization Research, CAS, Beijing 100190, China.", "address_ch": "李佳洺,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.陆大道,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.陈明星,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.徐成东,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.李扬,中国科学院中国现代化研究中心, 北京 100190, 中国.", "research_areas": "Sociology", "wos_categories": ""}

Their performance was evaluated by estimation error. The results show that MSN had the highest accuracy, while SS had the highest estimation error. ST and BK were intermediate in terms of their performance. Thus, MSN is an appropriate method that can be adopted to reduce the uncertainty of mean pollutant estimation in estuaries.

Changshu City close to Shanghai was taken as a representative small city in our study to analyze the relationship between urban heat island and various land-use types by using landscape ecology approach. The time-series HJ satellite images in 2013 were employed to map land use of Changshu, and multi-temporal Landsat-8 OLI images were used to inverse the seasonal surface temperature. The results indicated that the intensity of heat island of Changshu was the strongest in winter due to the \"warm island\" effect of paddy field and dryland, while the weakest in summer due to water body's cold island\" effect. Therefore, Changshu had a relatively favorable surface thermal environment. Meanwhile, the results also showed that there existed a threshold,beyond which the influence of waters,wetlands,forests on the urban heat island was no longer significant.

Analyzing the distribution characteristics of rural settlements and their impact has profound implications for rural reconstruction. Several types of spatial distribution of rural settlements, such as clustered, random, and uniform discrete distribution, were found in China with significant regional differences. Rural settlements were denser in the southeastern regions compared to the northwestern regions. In regions such as plains, the spatial distribution of rural settlements was denser and the spatial distribution modes were mainly random and disperse. In regions such as cold alpine areas and desert fringes, the rural settlements density was low and mainly clustered. In the transition zone between hills and mountains, the density of rural settlements was high and the spatial distribution mode was mainly random. Rural settlements distribution was influenced by traditions and the economy, with economic development becoming increasingly influential. Additional factors that affected rural settlements distribution included average distance to main roadway, agricultural machinery, per capita grain production, per capita arable land, population density, elevation, precipitation, etc. Multiple distribution patterns should be used to reconstruct rural spaces in different geographical areas.

Key research questions are which factors are critically responsible for the spatial pattern evident in the landscape and what is the relative importance of such factors? We used a new approach, i.e., the Geographical Detector to improve our spatial analysis. Using the combined methods of the Geographical Detector, digital image processing, field investigation and spatial and temporal analysis of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), we aimed to clarify the causal relations governing the different landform patterns within this Sandy Land and beyond. The primary factors include local relief, drainage, climatically controlled potential plant productivity, wind action and rock type as explanatory parameters x and the landscape properties as the output y. Our results show the quantified links between the spatial distribution of various landscapes and their controlling factors. This study revealed that the climatic potential productivity, local relief and drainage are the key factors in shaping the landscape spatial pattern. Owing to different regional climates and land use histories, the responses to changes of external forcing between the western and eastern parts of the Maowusu Sandy Land are out-of-step.

Considerable research has focused on the role of meteorological factors in HFMD development. Nonlinear relationship, delayed effects and collinearity problems are key issues for achieving robust and accurate estimations in this kind of weather -health relationship explorations. The current study was designed to address these issues and assess the impact of meteorological factors on HFMD in Guangdong, China.Methods: Case -based HFMD surveillance data and daily meteorological data collected between 2010 and 2012 was obtained from China CDC and Lhe National Meteorological Information Center, respectively. Alter a preliminary variable selection, for each dalasel boosted regression tree (BRT) models were applied to determine Lhe optimal lag for meteorological factors al which the variance of HFMD cases was most explained, and Lo assess Lhe impacts of these meteorological factors at the optimal lag.Results: Variance of HFMD cases was explained most by meteorological factors about 1 week ago. Younger children and those from the Pearl -River Delta Region were more sensitive to weather changes. Temperature had the largest contribution to HFMD epidemics (28.99-71.93%), followed by precipitation (6.52-16.11%), humidity (3.92-17.66%), wind speed (3.84-11.37%) and sunshine (621-10.36%). Temperature between 10 \"C and 25 C, as well as humidity between 70% and 90%, had a facilitating effect on the epidemic of HFMD. Sunshine duration above 9h and wind speed below 2.5 mjs also contributed to an elevated risk of HFMD. The positive relationship between HFMD and precipitation reversed when the daily amount of rainfall exceeded 25 mm.Conclusions :This study indicated significantly facilitating effects of five meteorological factors within some range on the epidemic of HFMD.

In this study, we collected daily influenza A (H1N1) cases and corresponding annual meteorological factors in mainland China from May 2009 to April 2010.

The results indicated that the influenza spanned a large geographical area, following an overall trend from east to west across the country. The spatio-temporal transmission of the disease was affected by a series of meteorological variables, especially absolute humidity with a 3-week lag.

Shanxi Province in China has the world's highest rate of NTDs. Since the 1990s, China's government has worked on many birth defect prevention programs to reduce the occurrence of NTDs, such as pregnancy planning, health education, genetic counseling, antenatal ultrasonography and serological screening. However, the rate of NTDs in Shanxi Province is still higher than the world's average morbidity rate after intervention. In addition, Shanxi Province has abundant coal reserves, and is the largest coal production province in China. The objectives of this study are to determine the temporal and spatial variation of the NTD rate in rural areas of Shanxi Province, China, and identify geographical environmental factors that were associated with NTDs in the risk area.MethodsIn this study, Heshun County and Yuanping County in Shanxi Province, which have high incidence of NTDs, were selected as the study areas. Two paired sample T test was used to analyze the changes in the risk of NTDs from the time dimension. Ripley's k function and spatial filtering were combined with geographic information system (GIS) software to study the changes in the risk of NTDs from the spatial dimension. In addition, geographical detectors were used to identify the risk geographical environmental factors of NTDs in the study areas, especially the areas close to the coal sites and main roads.ResultsIn both Heshun County and Yuanping County, the incidence of NTDs was significantly (P<0.05) reduced after intervention. The results from spatial analysis showed that significant spatial heterogeneity existed in both counties. NTD clusters were still identified in areas close to coal sites and main roads after interventions. This study also revealed that the elevation, fault and soil types always had a larger influence on the incidence of NTDs in our study areas. In addition, distance to the river was a risk factor of NTDs in areas close to the coal sites and main roads.ConclusionThe existing interventions may have played an important role to reduce the incidence of NTDs. However, there is still spatial heterogeneity in both counties after using the traditional intervention methods. The government needs to take more measures to strengthen the environmental restoration to prevent the occurrence of NTDs, especially those areas close to coal sites and main roads. The outcome of this research provides an important theoretical basis and technical support for the government to prevent the occurrence of NTDs.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "HIGH PREVALENCE;TRACE-ELEMENTS;FOLIC-ACID;RISK;AREA;POPULATION;EXPOSURE;RATES;SOIL", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Key Lab Surveillance & Early Warning Infect Dis, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Henan Acad Agr Sci, Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Zhengzhou 450002, Peoples R China\n[ 4 ]‎ Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Stat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA\n[ 5 ]‎ Curtin Univ, Dept Spatial Sci, Bentley, WA 6845, Australia\n[ 6 ]‎ Changan Univ, Xian 710054, Peoples R China\n[ 7 ]‎ Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Science & Technology - Other Topics", "wos_categories": "Multidisciplinary Sciences"}

The complex landscape mosaic in this area challenges the land cover classification based on the remote-sensing data. Spectral signatures are not efficient to discriminate all pixels into classes. To improve the recognition and handle the uncertainty, this paper provides a novel integrated approach, based on a fuzzy rough set and evidential reasoning (FRSER), for land cover classification in an urban fringe area. The approach is implemented on Landsat Operation Land Imager data covering the urban fringe area of Wuhan city, China. A fuzzy rough set is first used to define a decision table from multispectral imagery and ground reference data. Then the fuzzy rough information system is interpreted using the Dempster-Shafer theory, based on an evidential reasoning system. A final land cover classification with uncertainty is achieved by evidential reasoning. The results are compared with the traditional maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and some rough set-based classifiers including classical rough set classifier (RS), fuzzy rough set classifier (FRS), and variable precision fuzzy rough set classifier (VPFRS). The better overall accuracy, user's and producer's accuracies, and the kappa coefficient, in comparison with the other classifiers, suggest that the proposed approach can effectively discriminate land cover types in urban fringe areas with high inter-class similarities and intra-class heterogeneity. It is also capable of handling the uncertainty in data processing, and the final land cover map comes with a degree of uncertainty.

Previous studies have failed to quantify the relative role of determinants driving ADR and have been limited in assessing their interactive impacts. In this study, a spatial variance analysis-based geographical detector methodology is used to quantify the effects of geological, physical, and human factors on the occurrence of ADR in an area characterized by mountains and hills in northern China. It is found that soil type, precipitation, and wind velocity are the major determinants of ADR, which implies that geological and physical elements (e.g., soil attribute) and climatic factors (e.g., precipitation and wind velocity) rather than human activities have played a greater role in the incidence of ADR. Particularly, the results show that the interaction of various determinants causes significant non-linearly enhanced impacts on the ADR.

In recent years, the incidence of bacterial dysentery is rather prevalent in Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region. This paper analyzed the seasonal and population characteristics of bacillary dysentery in Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region in 2012 firstly. Then, we explored the spatial and temporal clustering of the incidence of bacillary dysentery by using hotspot analysis model. We also investigated the quantitative relationship between the incidence of bacterial dysentery and the social-economic factors by using geographical detector model. The results showed that: (1) the peak attack time of bacillary dysentery was August. The age range that had the highest incidence was 0-9 years old, followed by those above 80 years old. The population that had the highest incidence was farmers, followed by the scattered children. (2) The incidence of bacterial dysentery clustered in both space and time in Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region. In space, the high clustering regions for incidence of bacillary dysentery are mainly located in Fangshan District and Mentougou District of Beijing and Binhai New Area of Tianjin;the low clustering regions are mainly located in Luan county of Tangshan. In time, the disease occurred in all the 12 months in 2012 in the high clustering regions, but mainly occurred in January, February, March, April and June in the low clustering regions.

The following results were obtained: the farmland conversion level of Chongqing City presented significant temporalspatial differences. In detail, it was characterized by a spatial pattern ofcenter-peripherywith region I as the center, region II as the central expansion area, and regions III and IV as the periphery; the reason that the spatial distribution of the farmland conversion level of Chongqing was highly unbalanced mainly owes to interregional differences. The spatial disequilibrium displayed obvious wave-shaped variations during the research period; the formation mechanism of the spatial disequilibrium of the farmland conversion level in Chongqing differed in different districts and counties. The farmland conversion level was subjected to the influences of a variety of complex factors. The factor endowment, economic development level, social development status and policy system environment therein acted as the basic conditions, intrinsic impetus, backbone force and external conditions for the spatial disequilibrium of the farmland conversion level of the research region respectively; the dominant factors affecting the farmland conversion level in different districts and counties were obviously different. In summary, the farmland conversion level of the research region was significantly unbalanced in space due to the influences of diverse factors.

The result shows that the percentages of overall cases included in the STAT and HDMT networks are 92.93% and 97.05%, respectively. This means that both STAT and HDMT network models imply the overall transmission of the dengue fever outbreak. STAT network is assortative, and presents the cross infection in neighboring areas. On the contrary, HDMT network is disassortative, and it displays the diffusion infection character of the dengue fever outbreak. We earmark the location of outbreak center as well as the diffusion center with the degree of closeness centrality in STAT network and the degree of betweenness centrality in HDMT network.

The results are as follows: 1) The scale of rural settlements in northern Yanchi was curtailed but the intensive degree was increased. The shape of rural settlements appeared to be simpler and more regular, and the distribution center of the rural settlement migrated towards the southeast direction. 2) The spatial distribution of aggregation was further strengthened, and the distribution density showed \"dense inner and sparse outside\" spatial characteristics. The \"hot spot\" area of settlement scale was largely unchanged, but the \"cold spot\" area demonstrated apparent rotation characteristics. 3) During the eight-year period, the rural settlements gradually approached the grassland, woodland, and were far away from the sand source area, suggesting that the tension between people and land has eased off, and the ecological living environment in the area is gradually optimized by human in a positive manner. 4) The spatial distribution of rural settlements in the study area was mainly influenced by natural topography and location conditions.

The results are as follows: First, Population ageing varies spatially. Population ageing on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau usually shows an even distribution. Population ageing on the southeastern side of China usually shows a center-periphery type of distribution and coastal-inland contrast. Second, the mean value of aged population proportion increased from 6.7% to 8.0% between 2000 and 2010. By 2010, China had become an aged society. The counties that had high percentage of aged population concentrated in the interior, the Northeast, and along the silk road economic region. The spatial pattern of population ageing is relatively stable, but significant difference was found in the trend of population ageing change. Third, there are regional differences in the population ageing of China, characterized by differences between urban areas and the countryside, ethnic minority regions and other regions, and poverty-stricken region and non-poverty areas. But the direction of change is not consistent.

In this study, a new giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) habitat assessment method based on geographical detector (Geogdetector) is proposed. A total of 8 environmental factors were selected for the suitability assessment of giant panda habitat, including the elevation, slope, aspect, topographic position index, distance from drainage system, vegetation type, staple food sources of bamboo, and distance from human settlements. Based on the initial habitat suitability index (HSI) input data calculated by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and MAXENT model respectively, we used four geographical detectors (the risk detector, factor detector, ecological detector, and interaction detector) to assess the relationship between the suitability of giant panda habitat and their environmental risk factors. Results show that the suitability assessment of giant panda habitat based on the geographical detector has relatively favorable precision and feasibility.

Using the built-up land expansion in Beijing from 2000 to 2010 as a study case, this research aims to fill this gap. A spatial statistical method, named the geographical detector, was used to investigate the effects of physical and socioeconomic factors. The effects of policy factors were also explored using physical and socioeconomic factors as proxies. The results showed that the modifiable areal unit problem existed in the geographical detector, and 4000 m might be the optimal scale for the classification performed in this study. At this scale, the interactions between most factors enhanced each other, which indicated that the interactions had greater effects on the built-up land expansion than any single factor. In addition, two pairs of nonlinear enhancement, the greatest enhancement type, were found between the distance to rivers and two socioeconomic factors: the total investment in fixed assets and GDP. Moreover, it was found that the urban plans, environmental protection policies and major events had a great impact on built-up land expansion.

Main results for this study are as follows: 1) the rural settlement spatial distribution mode consists of cluster, random and uniform discrete distributions in China, while the regional differences were significant. The density of rural settlements is greater in the southeastern region than in the northwest region with Hu Huanyong's population distribution line for the boundary in China. There were a variety of characteristics for the rural settlement distribution in different type of regions. The spatial distribution of rural settlement was intensive, and those spatial distribution modes were mainly random and disperse with a short average nearest neighbor distance in plain areas. On the other side, the density of rural settlement was low, and those spatial distribution modes were mainly cluster relatively with a long average nearest neighbor distance in highland and cold areas and fringes of the desert. In addition, the density of rural settlement was high, and those spatial distribution modes were mainly random in the intersected transition zone between hill and mountain. 2) The dual factors affect the rural settlement distribution from traditional and economy. Although the traditional factors still play a significance role, the influence of the economic developed more and more obviously. There were a large amount of factors attributing to impacting rural settlement distribution, the spatial form of production and life space, including natural topography and water resources natural conditions, etc. That also included traffic condition, industry, economic development level and agricultural modernization. 3) With factors of production non-agriculture in rural region, the rural space need be a reconstructing optimization. The priority selection is to rebuild village-town system for optimizing rural physical space. Theoretically, village-town system is a sort of hierarchical structure, consisting of central regional town, general agricultural town, central village and basic village. 4) The multiple modes will been made use of restructuring rural space in different geographical areas, including balance forms of radiation, radiation disequilibrium forms, multicore equilibrium forms and corridor layout pattern or mixed modes.

The optimization consisted of two steps: reduce the redundant monitoring sites and then optimally add new sites to the remaining sites. After optimization, the inclusion of 51 sites in the monitoring network was found to produce a smaller total estimated error than that of the current network, which has 70 sites; moreover, the use of 55 sites can produce a higher precision of estimation for all three principal components (PCs) than that of the current 70 sites.

Results show that the spatial distribution of rural settlements in the Bohai Rim is remarkably varied. The number of rural settlement sites in a 5x5 km grid cell exceeding 5.0 are distributed in a six-area pattern in the Bohai Rim; rural settlement dispersion is particularly high in agricultural regions in south Hebei and southwest Shandong, suggesting rural settlement density keeps increasing from northeast to southwest, characterized by high density and dispersed spatial distribution in traditional agricultural regions. Furthermore, rural settlements show dramatic spatial differences in terms of distribution and dynamic change degrees in the Bohai Rim.

However, traditional agricultural regions have underdeveloped economies, industrialization and tertiary industries, characterized by low urbanization rates, with farmers not feeling assimilated in rural or urban areas.

Such information, however, is not used in the second process of class allocation. In this paper, a new class-allocation algorithm, named \"hybrid constraints of pure and mixed pixels\" (HCPMP), is proposed to allocate land-cover classes to subpixels using MSIs. HCPMP first determines the classes of subpixels that overlap with the pure pixels of auxiliary images in MSIs, after which the remaining subpixels are classified using information derived from the mixed pixels of the base image in MSIs. An artificial image and two remote sensing images were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed HCPMP algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that HCPMP successfully applied MSIs to produce SRM maps that are visually closer to the reference images and that have greater accuracy than five existing class-allocation algorithms. Especially, it can produce more accurate SRM maps for high-resolution land-cover classes than low-resolution cases.

In the study, we investigated spatio-temporal variations of S. japonicum infection risk in Anhui Province and assessed the associations of the disease with key environmental factors with the aim of understanding the mechanism of the disease and seeking clues to effective and sustainable schistosomiasis control.Methodology/Principal FindingsInfection data of schistosomiasis from annual conventional surveys were obtained at the village level in Anhui Province, China, from 2000 to 2010 and used in combination with environmental data. The spatio-temporal kriging model was used to assess how these environmental factors affected the spatio-temporal pattern of schistosomiasis risk. Our results suggested that seasonal variation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), seasonal variation of land surface temperature at daytime (LSTD), and distance to the Yangtze River were negatively significantly associated with risk of schistosomiasis. Predictive maps showed that schistosomiasis prevalence remained at a low level and schistosomiasis risk mainly evolved along the Yangtze River. Schistosomiasis risk also followed a focal spatial pattern, fluctuating temporally with a peak (the largest spatial extent) in 2005 and then contracting gradually but with a scattered distribution until 2010.ConclusionThe fitted spatio-temporal kriging model can capture variations of schistosomiasis risk over space and time. Combined with techniques of geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS), this approach facilitates and enriches risk modeling of schistosomiasis, which in turn helps to identify prior areas for effective and sustainable control of schistosomiasis in Anhui Province and perhaps elsewhere in China.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "BANK LOAN PROJECT;GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION;ONCOMELANIA-HUPENSIS;SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION;HELMINTH INFECTIONS;RISK;EPIDEMIOLOGY;IMPACT;TIME;INTERPOLATION", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Minist Educ, Key Lab Publ Hlth Safety, Shanghai, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Lab Spatial Anal & Modeling, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China\n[ 4 ]‎ Ingerod, Brastad, Sweden\n[ 5 ]‎ Fudan Univ, Biomed Stat Ctr, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China\n[ 6 ]‎ Anhui Inst Parasit Dis, Wuhu, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine", "wos_categories": "Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine"}

First of all, the spatial-temporal variations of vegetation in Xinjiang area over the last 30 years were analyzed using 1982-2011 GIMMS NDVI3g data as the indicator of vegetation activity. Secondly, the effects of mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, sunshine duration, mean annual wind velocity, DEM, slope and aspect, soil type and vegetation type were selected as potential physical geographic factors. Finally, the influence of physical geographic factors on vegetation change in Xinjiang area was analyzed using the Geographical Detector model. The results show that: (1) the annual coverage of vegetation in Xinjiang area was gradually increasing in 1982-2011 years (linear rate 0.0017/a, P=0.000). (2) the area of vegetation improvement was greater than the area of vegetation degradation.

Based on a large-scale questionnaire survey of livable city of Beijing in 2013, factor analysis was applied to extract perception factors of residents' livability satisfaction. Then we used the geographical detector method to reveal the influence mechanism of livability satisfaction from the perspective of livable satisfaction's perception factors and individual and family characteristics.

Pollution and noise, natural environment, and convenient transportation are key factors among the livability perception factors.

Main results for this study are as follows: (1) the spatial differentiation of rural settlements was significant in the Bohai Rim in China. The regions with more than five natural villages in a 5 km * 5 km grid were located in agricultural and mountainous areas, especially in southern Hebei province and southwestern Shandong province, with \"6\" glyph spatial pattern, gradually increasing from northeast to southwest in the Bohai Rim in China, where the rural settlements were scattered, and rural settlement land was used extensively. The density of rural settlements and scattered degree are much higher in the traditional agricultural regions. Besides, the spatial differences of rural residential land and dynamic change were significant in the Bohai Rim in China. In terms of scale, the areas of rural residential land were larger in the plain area with a higher density of rural settlements, especially in the Huang-Huai- Hai Plain and southern Shandong Peninsula, and most of the rural residential lands area scale was more than 3 sq km in the 5 km*5 km grid. In the traditional agricultural areas, economic development, industrialization and business- service development have lagged behind, with industrial development in an initial stage, so that a low urbanization rate has been found. The livelihood of most farmers is dual status between urban and rural areas. (3) On time series, the rural residential land areas increased in the traditional agricultural region.

The model is to discrete the continuous geographic data based on the values. Based on this analysis, the paper discusses the performance of four classification methods (Equal Interval-EI, Quantile Value-QV, Natural Break-NB, and Geometrical Interval-GI) in the model for the Peiligang period, the Early Yangshao period, the Late Yangshao period, and the Longshan period. It then analyzes the structure, development pattern, distribution, and scope of the settlements for a better understanding of the human-environment relationship in prehistoric settlements from the perspective of societal organization and development state and cultural and behavioral patterns of humans in prehistoric time. The results show that: (1) Optimal discretization of site-river distance is realized using the classification method of NB, QV, NB, and GI with class number of 8, 8, 8, and 6 for the four periods. The power of this determinant for determining the density of sites is 39.5%, 70.8%, 73.0%, 59.8%; (2) Floods caused the terrace on both sides of the river to collapse gradually and reduced the area of the terrace. In order to gain more living space within the limited area, the sites dispersed along the river. When the terrace area became too small, dispersion along the river was too costly and the ancient settlements began to expand away from the river. Therefore the determining power of the factor of site-river distance first increased and then decreased.

The driving force of settlement development changed from population growth in the early stage to structural change of the society. Settlement distribution and human activities concentrated within 1~2.5 hours walking distance from the river and continued to expand.

Our overarching hypothesis is that human activity has modified certain ecological factors in a way that has affected the connectivity of urban forest landscapes. Therefore, spatiotemporal distributions of landscape connectivity should be similar to those of ecological factors and can be represented quantitatively. Integral indices of connectivity and population density were employed to represent urban forest landscape connectivity and human activity, respectively. We then simulated the spatial relationship between forest patches and population density with Conefor 2.6 software. A geographical detector model was used to identify the dominant factors that affect urban forest landscape connectivity. The results showed that a distance of 600 m was the threshold of node importance. Mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, elevation, patch area, population density and dominant species had significant effects on the node importance. Mean annual temperature was more significant than population density in controlling the spatial pattern of the delta of the integral index of connectivity (dIIC).

Geographical languages are essential for understanding, investigating, representing and propagating geo-spatial information. Geographical languages have developed and evolved gradually with improvements in science, technology and cognitive levels. Concerning the theoretical progress from geographical information ontology, epistemology and linguistic theory, this paper firstly puts forward the concept of a GIS language and discusses its basic characteristics according to changes in the structures, functions and characteristics of geographical languages. This GIS language can be regarded as a system of synthetic digital symbols. It is a comprehensive representation of geographical objects, phenomena and their spatial distributions and dynamic processes. This representation helps us generate a universal perception of geographical space using geographical scenarios or symbols with geometry, statuses, 'processes, spatio-temporal relationships, semantics and attributes. Furthermore, this paper states that the GIS language represents a new generation of geographical language due to its intrinsic characteristics, structures, functions and systematic content. Based on the aforementioned. theoretical foundation, this paper illustrates the pivotal status and contributions of the GIS language from the perspective of geographical researchers. The language of GIS is a new geographical language designed for the current era, with features including spatio-temporal multi-dimension representation, interactive visualization, virtual geographical scenarios, multi-sensor perception and expedient broadcasting via the web.The GIS language is the highest-level geographical language developed to date, integrating semantic definitions, feature extraction, geographical dynamic representation and spatio-temporal factors and unifying the computation of geographical phenomena and objects. The GIS language possesses five important characteristics: abstraction, systematicness, strictness, precision and hierarchy. In summary, the GIS language provides a new means for people to recognize, understand and simulate entire geo-environments. Therefore, exploration of the GIS language's functions in contemporary geographical developments is becoming increasingly important. Similarly, construction of the conceptual model and scientific systems of the GIS language will promote the development of the disciplines of geography and geographical information sciences. Therefore, this paper investigates the prospects of the GIS language from the perspectives of digital technology, geographical norms, geographical modeling and the disciplinary development of geography.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "GIS;language;conceptual model;ontology;ONTOLOGIES", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Minist Educ, Key Lab Virtual Geog Environm, Nanjing 210046, Jiangsu, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Dept Resources & Environm & Tourism Management, Hengyang 421008, Hunan, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Engn Tech Lab Digital Protect Tradit Village Huna, Hengyang 421008, Hunan, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Physical Geography", "wos_categories": "Geography, Physical"}

In our previous studies, Rough set method has been successfully used in the analysis of social and environmental causes of neural tube birth defects. However, both roughness and fuzziness may co-exist in spatial data because of the complexity of the object and the subjective limitation of human knowledge. The situation of fuzzy decisions, which is often encountered in spatial data, is beyond the capability of classical rough set theory. This paper presents a model based on rough fuzzy sets to extract spatial fuzzy decision rules from spatial data that simultaneously have two types of uncertainties, roughness and fuzziness. Fuzzy entropy and fuzzy cross entropy are used to measure accuracies of the fuzzy decisions on unseen objects using the rules extracted. An example of neural tube birth defects is given in this paper. The identification result from rough fuzzy sets based model was compared with those from two classical rule extraction methods and three commonly used fuzzy set based rule extraction models.

Nine relevant driving factors, including both natural and anthropogenic factors, were studied in regard to their relationships with KRD transformation between 2000 and 2010. Our results demonstrate the relative importance of driving data in influencing the improvement and deterioration of KRD. Lithology, soil type and road influence are identified as the leading factors. Interestingly, to our study at least, there is no significant difference between the impacts of natural and anthropogenic factors influencing KRD improvement, and even natural factors have a higher impact on KRD deterioration.

In this paper, the spatial-temporal differences in 2001-2010 and the impact factors of this spatial difference in 2010 were analyzed to better understand the distribution of the newly increased cultivated land obtained through land consolidation in the province at the county level. All data used were acquired mainly from the land consolidation accounts and the statistical yearbooks. The research methods included the locational Gini-coefficient, geographic concentration and geographical detectors. Compared to other detective spatial analysis methods, the geographical detector was usable for both quantitative data and nominal data to extract the implicit interrelationships between explanatory variables and response variables. The results showed that 1) In 2001-2010, the amount of newly increased cultivated land obtained through land consolidation of the whole province presented a trend of significant growth, and the geographical distribution of the newly increased cultivated land was also highly concentrated. The Gini coefficient, which was 0.809 in 2001, fell straight to the lowest of 0.540 in 2009 and then rose abruptly to 0.701 in 2010. 2) Influenced by the topography and the land consolidation policy of Hubei province, the newly increased cultivated land at the county level presented obvious regional differences in 2001-2010.

According to the resource endowments,socio-economic development,population status in different areas of Gansu Province,China,and taking county as the basic unit,this paper deals with the imbalances in levels and speed of urbanization development among the different regions. Using the natural breakpoint grading method in the ArcGIS software,it can be found that the county urbanization evolution of the various regions is different. The disparities connected with urbanization are huge between the western and the eastern of Gansu. The highlight regions of urbanization process in the central region belong to Lanzhou and Baiyin City,while the urbanization development in its other region is inferior. The paper builds up a level of urbanization development indicators,including four aspects: spatial concentration of population,economic growth, social development,infrastructure construction,and analyzes Gansu province regional disparities of county urbanization by the coefficients of variation,Williamson coefficient,maximum and minimum coefficient. Overall,the urbanization internal differences of the regions with high urbanization levels are larger,and urbanization internal differences of the regions with low urbanization levels are smaller. The urbanization levels of the counties in the southern region were significantly lower than that in the northern region. The core content and innovation of this paper is using geographic detector model to explore the real mechanisms of different regions  disparities in the urbanization development from the external representation of the urbanization levels index. The different regions are affected by the different factors ' contribution in the urbanization process. The social-economic development is the mainly effective factor to promote the urbanization of the Hexi region,improved living condition and accelerating urbanization process,but in recent years its growth rate slowing down; the central region gets relatively high score dew to the various elements, including population increase, economic and social development and infrastructure construction. The southern region is an ethnic living area,the impact of the various elements is smaller and the urbanization is slow. The Longnan region increases in the proportion of tertiary industry and urbanization process accelerates. The Long-dong region's urbanization is greatly affected by the constructions of energy resource and chemical industry bases and highway. Based on the models of development in the different regions three proposals are put forward: the Hexi region should focus on urban agglomeration development to drive the surrounding county to accelerate the development,thus narrowing the regional internal difference. The southern region should increase government fiscal,financial support capabilities to provide adequate and long-term stable funding premise for county urbanization in the ethnic minority areas. The Longdong area should adopt a development model that is driven by the development of the central city,while the development of the surrounding county realizes the coordinated development of central cities and small towns.", "abstract_ch": "以甘肃省各县域作为研究单元,首先利用ArcGIS软件中的自然断点分级法,对其县域差异演化过程进行分析。其次采用变异系数、威廉森系数、最大最小系数,分析甘肃省各地区县域城镇化地域差异特征。最后利用地理探测器模型对县域城镇化地域分异成因进行分析。研究表明:(1)甘肃省各地区县域城镇化仍存在一定的差距,东西差距明显,而中部地区除兰州、白银地区城镇化进程突出外,其他地区发展缓慢。(2)各地区内部县域城镇化差异特征不尽相同,陇中地区主要表现为空间集聚和基础设施建设差异较大;河西地区主要表现为经济增长和社会发展差异大,南部地区城镇化率普遍偏低,内部差异不大。(3)各地区城镇化进程差异实质机理并不相同,除陇东地区受到基础设施建设的影响最为突出外,其他地区都显示为受经济增长及社会发展影响最大。", "keywords_en": "county urbanization; geographical features; formation mechanisms; Gansu Province", "keywords_ch": "县域城镇化; 地域差异; 形成机理; 甘肃省", "address_en": "Yang Bo,College of Geography and Environmental sciences Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730070, China.Shi Peiji,College of Geography and Environmental sciences Northwest Normal University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730070, China.", "address_ch": "杨勃,西北师范大学地理与环境科学学院, 兰州, 甘肃 730070, 中国.石培基,西北师范大学地理与环境科学学院, 兰州, 甘肃 730070, 中国.", "research_areas": "Business & Economics", "wos_categories": ""}

It was widespread in southern China several decades ago and the disease prevention effort of the Chinese government and researchers achieved remarkable results in reducing infections. However, in recent year, the epidemic situation has worsened due to a series of changes in the natural environment and socioeconomic conditions. As the only intermediate host of Schistosome, Oncomelania hupensis plays an important role in the spread of this disease and its control is critical for the prevention and control of Schistosome. Therefore, identifying the environmental factors that determine the distribution of the snail could help predict the distribution and extent of snail breeding sites, obtain a macroscopic view on snail spreading trend, and take effective measures to eliminate the snails. In this paper, we aim to determine key indictors that could be used in remote sensing monitoring of Oncomelania hupensis breeding extent and density. Hubei Province is one of the serious epidemic areas in China. Oncomelania hupensis here can be classified into three subtypes: the subtype inside embankments, subtype outside embankments, and subtype in hilly areas, according to the geographical environment of snail habitats. We take into account several environmental factors including elevation, nearest distance to river (water), land use, soil and vegetation to analyze their influence on snail distribution. Geographical Detector Model used in this research is based on spatial variation analysis of the geographical strata to assess the health risks in different environment. It contains four geographical detectors: factor detector identifies which factors are responsible for the risk; ecological detector compares the relative importance of risk factors; risk detector discloses where the high risk areas are; and interaction detector reveals whether the risk factors interact or lead to disease independently. The main procedures of our analysis are as follows: first, both snail statistics and environmental data are collected and preprocessed with ArcGIS Desktop software; then the environmental indicators that are strongly related to snail distribution are identified by the factor detector and ecological detector; finally, favorable (suitable) type or range of each indicator as well as the reference factors that indirectly influence the snails can be computed from the risk detector and interaction detector. It is found that for the subtype inside embankments, vegetation coverage of epidemic season (March to October), especially July to September, determines the extent of distribution, while high density areas are characterized by moderate silt content in soil texture, yellowish red soil and submerged paddy soil, high vegetation coverage in the first quarter of the year. The subtype outsider embankments distributed mainly at lake beaches with high vegetation coverage, while high vegetation coverage in the first quarter, reed and amur silver grass vegetation contributes to its abundance. In hilly areas, there is no clear indicator for the extent of distribution of the subtype due to the relatively complex environment, yet woodland and farmland close to river, waterlogged paddy soil as well as submerged paddy soil are strongly related to high dense of the snails. This result is consistent with previous studies. The result and method of this research could provide scientific reference for policy makers and researchers to take efficient measures to control snail prevalence.", "abstract_ch": "近年来，由于自然环境、经济社会等因素影响，中国血吸虫病疫情呈回升态势，表现为急性感染人数和血吸虫病患病人数增多，局部地区钉螺扩散明显，感染性钉螺分布范围逐渐扩大等。钉螺是血吸虫的唯一中间宿主，控制钉螺对血吸虫病防治具有重要意义。本文根据钉螺的生态学特征，综合高程、水文、土地利用、土壤、植被等因子，基于地理探测器模型分析了地理环境因子对2009年湖北省钉螺分布的影响。结果表明：①在垸内型流行区，整个流行季(3-10月)、特别是7-9月期间的植被覆盖与钉螺分布范围有关，密螺地带的特征为土壤质地粉砂含量适中、黄红壤和淹育水稻土，第一季度有较高的植被覆盖度；②在垸外型流行区，湖泊滩地、高覆盖度草地是其主要分布环境，而第一季度较高的植被覆盖，尤其是荻、芦苇等植被类型是高密度地区的环境特征；③在山地丘陵，河流附近的林地和耕地，潴育或淹育水稻土是钉螺密集分布的环境。筛选出的地理环境指示因子可用于遥感技术监测钉螺孳生地，从而为采取有效的控螺措施提供科学依据。", "keywords_en": "snail; schistosomiasis; geographical environmental factor; geographical detector; key indicator; Hubei Province", "keywords_ch": "钉螺; 血吸虫病; 地理环境因子; 地理探测器; 指示作用; 湖北省", "address_en": "Tong Laga,State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information Systems, Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Xu Xinliang,State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information Systems, Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Fu Ying,State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information Systems, Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Wei Fenghua,Hubei Institute of Parasitic Diseases, Wuhan, Hubei 430079, China.", "address_ch": "通拉嘎,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.徐新良,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.付颖,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.魏凤华,湖北省血吸虫病防治研究所, 武汉, 湖北 430079, 中国.", "research_areas": "Geology", "wos_categories": ""}

This paper therefore uses the coefficient of variation and the geographical detector tool to analyze systematically the spatial disparities of NETDZs in China by their EGR in 2010. The result shows that: (1) Overall, EGR of NETDZs in China shows a large difference between eastern, central and western parts of the country with a U-shaped curve, that is, lowest growth rate in central China; (2) Within each region, the spatial disparity of EGR of NETDZs has different characteristics- such disparity is highest in western China followed by eastern China, and is lowest in central China; (3) The national scale factor detection shows that decision forces of the potential determinants vary only slightly. However, significant difference is detected in the analysis for individual regions, which means that the key determinants for the spatial disparities of EGR in NETDZs in the three regions are quite different; (4) Among the 5 key determinants, internal determinants from inside the NETDZs are more dominated in central China and western China while external determinants from host city and regional context are more dominated in eastern China: changes in labor cost, the volume of foreign trade, preferential policy in NETDZs, spatial accessibility of the host city, and industrial support from the host city are the top 5 determinants in the central area of China. Preferential policy change, industrial support from the host city, change in the volume of foreign trade, relative economies scale of NETDZ, and investment level of host city are the top 5 determinants in the western part of China. For NETDZs in eastern China, the top 5 determinants are changes in preferential policy and labor cost, the level of total investment, economic development, and economic growth rate of the host city. (5) The pattern of spatial disparities of EGRs and determinants in NETDZs in three regions in China reflects, to a certain extent, the evolution stage in the life circle of ETDZs development. Based on this, we recommend that in the near future, the development of NETDZs in central China and western China should focus on improving their internal factors such as lowering labor cost, increasing volume of foreign trade and applying more effective preferential policies, while in the long run, external factors, such as spatial accessibility of the host city and industrial support from the host city, will become increasingly important to NETDZ development, meaning that the development of NETDZs will be eventually more dependent on how well they can be integrated into the host city and to a large extent, the urban region.", "abstract_ch": "建设国家级经济技术开发区(经开区)是中国扩大对外开放和促进区域发展的重要政策。历经30年多发展，国家级经开区已遍布全国，其个体间的发展差异也由于不同的动力机制而日趋显著。认识和探讨国家级经开区经济增长率的空间分异及其核心影响因素，对因地制宜制定发展策略、引导开发区高效发展具有重要意义。运用变异系数和地理探测器方法，分析2010年国家级经开区经济增长率的空间分异，并探测了其核心影响因素。结果表明：①总体上，国家级经开区经济增长率在东中西三大区差异显著，呈现出高低高的U型格局；②个体上，国家级经开区经济增长率在三大区内部存在不同分异特征，其中西部分异度最大、东部次之、中部最小；③探测因子决定力显示，主导三大地区国家级经开区经济增长率的核心要素明显不同；在所选出的5大核心影响因素中，中西东三大区呈现出由开发区内在因子主导向城市和区域性外在因子主导的转变趋势；④国家级经开区经济增长率及核心影响因素在三大区间的分异特征，一定程度上反映了开发区生命周期阶段性的演变规律。由此建议：近期内，中西部国家级经开区仍应聚焦于改进其自身发展要素；而从长远看，城市性和区域性的外部因子对经开区的影响将变得日益重要，亦即是经开区的未来发展将越来越依赖于与其所在城市和区域的有效融合。", "keywords_en": "NETDZs; economic growth rate; spatial disparity; coefficient of variation; geographical detector; China", "keywords_ch": "国家级经济技术开发区; 经济增长率; 空间差异; 变异系数; 地理探测器; 中国", "address_en": "Ding Yue,Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Cai Jianming,Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Ren Zhoupeng,Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Yang Zhengshan,Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.", "address_ch": "丁悦,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 北京 100101, 中国.蔡建明,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 北京 100101, 中国.任周鹏,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 北京 100101, 中国.杨振山,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 北京 100101, 中国.", "research_areas": "Geography", "wos_categories": ""}

The results led to the following findings. 1. The vegetable planting model is the major determinant of the spatial stratification of FQ in the soil. For example, the \"cucumber-cucumber\" model (growing cucumbers after cucumbers) has a three-fold power of determinant compared to the \"pepper-melon\" model (growing melons after peppers). 2. Planting age (years with continuous vegetable cultivation) does not necessarily affect the spatial distribution of FQ owing to their relatively short degradation period. 3. Interactions between risk factors were more significant than the individual factors for FQ pollution. In particular, the interaction between the vegetable planting model and amount of manure resulted in the highest pollution level. The findings of the present study make it possible to introduce effective and practical measures to alleviate pollution of soils by FQ in the study area. Adjustment of the vegetable cultivation models and application of chicken manure (less than 6 kg/m(2) manure annually with a more dry than fresh manure) could be an effective and flexible approach to alleviate FQ pollution.

However, the exact sources of the disease and its main epidemiological characteristics have not yet been clearly identified.Methods and Findings: Numbers of typhoid and paratyphoid cases per day during the period 2006 to 2010 were obtained from the Chinese Center of Disease Control (CDC). A number of suspected disease determinants (or their proxies), were considered for use in spatiotemporal analysis: these included locations of discharge canals and food markets, as well as socio-economic and environmental factors. Results showed that disease prevalence was spatially clustered with clusters decreasing with increasing distance from markets and discharge canals. More than half of the spatial variance could be explained by a combination of economic conditions and availability of health facilities. Temporal prevalence fluctuations were positively associated with the monthly precipitation series. Polluted hospital and residential wastewater was being discharged into rainwater canals. Salmonella bacteria were found in canal water, on farmland and on vegetables sold in markets.Conclusion: Disease transmission in Hongta district is driven principally by two spatiotemporally coupled cycles: one involving seasonal variations and the other the distribution of polluted farmland (where vegetables are grown and sold in markets). Disease transmission was exacerbated by the fact that rainwater canals were being used for disposal of polluted waste from hospitals and residential areas.

We aimed to develop a spatial model based on generalized additive model (GAM) plus cokriging to examine and model the expected incidences of NTD and make the inference of the incidence risk.Methods: We developed a spatial model to predict the expected incidences of NTD at village level in Heshun County, Shanxi Province, China, a region with high NTD cases. GAM was used to establish linear and non-linear relationships between local covariates and the expected NTD incidences. We examined the following village-level covariates in the model: projected coordinates, soil types, lithodological classes, distance to watershed, rivers, faults and major roads, annual average fertilizer uses, fruit and vegetable production, gross domestic product, and the number of doctors. The residuals from GAM were assumed to be spatially auto-correlative and cokriged with regional residuals to improve the prediction. Our approach was compared with three other models, universal kriging, generalized linear regression and GAM. Cross validation was conducted for validation.Results: Our model predicted the expected incidences of NTD well, with a good CV R-2 of 0.80. Important predictive factors included the fertilizer uses, locations of the centroid of each village, the shortest distance to rivers and faults and lithological classes with significant spatial autocorrelation of residuals. Our model out-performed the other three methods by 16% or more in term of R-2.Conclusions: The variance explained by our model was approximately 80%.

GIS language could be regarded as a synthetic and digital symbolic system. It is a comprehensive representation of geographical objects, phenomenon and their spatial distribution and dynamic processes. This representation helps us to generate a universal perception of geography space by the geographical scenarios or symbols with geometry, status, processes, temporal-spatial relationship, semantic and attribution features. Furthermore, this paper states that GIS language is a new generation geographical language by its intrinsic characteristics, structure, functions and systematic content. As the formers theoretical foundation, the paper definitely illustrates the important status and contributions of the GIS language to geographical researches. All in all, GIS language is the new geographical language with some new features including temporal-spatial multi-dimension representation, interactive visualization, virtual geographical scenario, multi-sensor sensing, expediently broadcasting with web, in current new era. GIS language is the highest level of geographical language because it integrates the semantic definition, features extraction, geographical dynamic representation and temporal-spatial unifying computation of geographical objects. GIS language have five important characteristics: abstraction, systemization, strictness, definition and hierarchical structure. In summary, GIS language provides a new tool for the recognition, understanding and simulation of the whole geographical environments. So, the exploration of GIS languages function in contemporary geographical development becomes increasingly important.

In this paper, we integrate air dispersion modeling and Geographic Information System (GIS) based spatial analysis methods to characterize regional ambient air quality at a relatively fine geographical scale (1 km x 1 km) while ascertaining source contributors. The temporal variation analysis shows that sulfur dioxide (SO2) pollution in Dallas County, Texas did not consistently increase or decrease from 1996 to 2002. The lowest and highest mean levels of annual SO2 concentrations at all the receptors (n = 2000) were 0.39 mu g m(-3) and 2.32 mu g m(-3) in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Meanwhile, analysis results suggest that the annual SO2 concentrations in a small part of Dallas County slightly declined with the highest value of -1.00 mu g m(-3) over the 1996-2002 period, while most of the county experienced increased SO2 concentration levels from 0.00 to 0.25 mu g m(-3). In addition, the source apportionment analysis demonstrated that the variations in total annual SO2 concentrations in Dallas County from 1996 to 2002 were significantly different from those by source classification. That is, compared to industrial emission sources, on-road vehicle emission sources caused variations in annual SO2 concentrations with relatively larger extents (power of determinant = 0.42). However, extreme variations in concentrations were due to industrial emission sources (3.45% vs. 0.00%). Based on these observations, it can be concluded that the combination of air dispersion modeling and GIS-based spatial analysis shows promise to overcome the drawbacks of sparse intraurban air quality monitoring in characterizing the spatial-temporal micro-variations in regional ambient air quality and ascertaining roles of source contributors over long-term periods.

Spatial association rule mining, discovery of interesting, meaningful rules in spatial databases, ignores autocorrelation of spatial data,or just generalizes the spatial data into attribute data currently. In most of the ways on spatial association rules mining, they transferred the spatial relations into non-spatial relations by virtue of spatial analysis. This means the separation of spatial autocorrelation from spatial association rule mining. In order to study the relations between spatial autocorrelation and spatial association rule mining,in this paper, the spatial association rules were mined by developed Apriori algorithm. Then, spatial autocorrelation analysis was implemented in the same spatial data set. A basic assumption of many spatial association rules mining is lacking for a priori information about spatial attributes. The two dimensional spatial autocorrelation results were used as priori knowledge in spatial association rules mining in this paper. The experimental data is about the amount of the hay fever(disease caused by pollen allergic rhinitis) patients and its factors, including temperature, precipitation and vegetation types of each county in the United Kingdom in 2000.The obtained frequent itemsets and the spatial association rules prove that factors have stronger correlation with hay fever(correlation coefficient is lager) appear with hay fever simultaneously more frequently in the spatial database, which confirms the existence of the effects that spatial autocorrelation has on spatial association rule mining. The analysis results not only point out the relation between spatial autocorrelation and spatial association rule mining, but also provide priori knowledge in the process of spatial association rule mining, making the mining process more targeted. Besides, without calculating the Cartesian in developed Apriori algorithm, spatial autocorrelation analysis can get the correlation coefficients efficiently, making the mining process more effectively.

No single determinant was found to dominate the NTD occurrence in the study area.
