However, little information is available about the relationship between poverty and vegetation dynamics in these areas. In this study, we used remote sensing and statistical datasets from 2000 to 2015 to identify the relations between vegetation dynamics and poverty among the NPDC in southwest rocky desertification areas. We estimated the vegetation dynamics using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and poverty with the rural per capita net income. Local indicator of spatial association and the space-time transition type of poverty were applied to identify spatial patterns of the poverty spatial distribution relationship and transition. Also, poverty, natural and ecological governance factors were assessed using the Geo-detector method to uncover the driving factors of karst vegetation. The results showed that vegetation increased significantly (p < 0.05) in karst NPDC (82.82%) and rocky desertification control counties (78.77%). The karst NPDC was significantly clustered. The hot spots of rural per capita net income changed from west and north (2000) to only north (2015) and cold spots changed from east and south (2000) to only south (2015). The rural per capita net income spatiotemporal transition was higher in 2000 than in 2015. We found a weak synergy between vegetation change and poverty type transition in 42.86% of the browning counties, 45.45% in the slowly greening counties, and 43.65% in stable greening counties. However, 57.50% of counties in the quick greening counties showed a tradeoff relationship with the poverty type transition. The rocky desertification rate and ecological engineering measures affected vegetation dynamics importantly. The results will help decision-makers to understand the interdependence between vegetation and poverty. This will contribute to better policies formulation to tackle poverty in the karst rocky desertification area. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Stratified ordinary kriging (SOK), which considers the sharp spatial variability of SOC due to natural factors and human activities, is a feasible way to map SOC with high spatial heterogeneity. However, conventional stratified methods are arbitrary and may therefore result in unnecessary and ineffective stratification. In addition, SOK performs poorly when soil properties of some strata present a local trend. In this study, we propose a geographical detector-based stratified regression kriging (GD-SRK) strategy, which aims to guide the stratification, gain strata-dependent knowledges, and improve the performance of stratified kriging. The study area locates in Jianghan Plain, China. The soil and land use types are used as categorical variables, while land use percentages are used as continuous variables. Ordinary kriging (OK), regression kriging (RK), and geographical detector-based stratified ordinary kriging are used as references of GD-SRK. Results indicated that the spatial heterogeneity of SOC was attributed to the differences in soil types and land use types and suggested that the study area should be stratified into four. The spillover effect of land use on the SOC content depended on the strata. Specifically, the SOC in strata II (paddy fields n Fluvisols) and IV (irrigated lands n Fluvisols) was unaffected by land use percentages and was estimated via OK. The SOC in strata I (paddy fields n Anthrosols and Luvisols) and III (irrigated lands n Anthrosols and Luvisols) was negatively correlated with the percentage of irrigated lands. Thus, their estimation of SOC via RK was possible. Using these knowledges, the GD-SRK outperformed the other methods by obtaining highest prediction accuracy and R-2.

We quantified spatiotemporal variations in SOC in three typical regions (Shuyang, Rugao, and Shanghai) in southeastern China during 1981-2011, by using geographically weighted regression (GWR), and explored the drivers with a geographical detector method. A total of 219 topsoil samples were collected in the three regions to measure the SOC in 2011, and a total of 109 SOC data for 1981 were obtained from the soil survey reports of Shuyang, Rugao, and Shanghai, which involved in the database of the second national soil survey of China. The results showed that the mean SOC contents in 2011 were 14.68 g kg(-1), 9.55 g kg(-1), and 18.00 g kg(-1) in Shuyang, Rugao, and Shanghai, respectively. The topography (q = 0.60) and the sand content of the soil (q = 0.70) were the main drivers of the spatial variability in the SOC in Shuyang and Rugao, while the carbon inputs (q = 0.68) predominantly explained the spatial heterogeneity of the SOC in Shanghai. Significant increases in SOC storage occurred in Shuyang and Rugao from 1981 to 2011, with increase rates of 0.55 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and 0.26 t ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. Land use change (dryland farming to rice cultivation) was identified as the largest driver of the SOC increases in Shuyang and Rugao (q values of 0.16 and 0.09, respectively), followed by increasing carbon inputs (0.14 and 0.07). However, the SOC storage in Shanghai rapidly decreased at a rate of -0.38 t ha(-1) yr(-1) during 1981-2011. The land use change from wetlands to rice cultivation was the primary reason for the decreasing SOC (q = 0.24), and a net decrease in carbon inputs between 1981 and 2011 was another main driver of the reduction in the SOC in Shanghai (q = 0.14).

In this study, we assessed relationships between the surface-mat stability of the topsoil (0-10 cm depth), vegetation cover, species diversity, growth patterns, indicator plant species for high and low tensile strength, soil texture, total nitrogen, and soil organic carbon.Vegetation composition significantly influenced the surface-mat stability of subalpine grasslands. Some key species were associated with higher reinforcement than other species. However, surface-mat stability neither depended on the vegetation type (grass or forb), nor on the root type, but rather on individual species characteristics such as roots and clonal structures as well as a certain plant and structural diversity. A balanced nutrient supply was associated with higher surface-mat stability, while soil texture had no effect. We hypothesized that stabilizing effects of plant-plant connections in tightly interwoven, dense root and clonal structure systems dominate over effects of root-soil connections. Thus, effects of soil texture may be negligible for the surface-mat stability.

Based on the experimental results, there is still considerable room for yield improvement as the ALUI of similar to 73.1 % counties are lower than 0.7 while the 53.60 % counties are lower than 0.6. Furthermore, the ALUI dataset shows significant global spatial autocorrelation characteristic. Boundaries of regions that aggregated by counties with high ALUI are more consistent with that of provincial administrative districts, comparing with that of substandard farming system regions. On the other hand, counties with low ALUI are mostly cluster in mountains, hills, or plateaus, where grain yield is mainly limited by regional hydrothermal conditions. In addition, counties with different ALUI status have been divided into six classes, using k-means clustering algorithm.

Creating independence by sampling implies that DB may neglect spatial autocorrelation (SAC) if the sampling interval is beyond the SAC range. In MB, however, a particular sampling design can be irrelevant for inferential results. Empirical studies further showed that MSE (mean squared error) values for both DB and MB are affected by SAC and spatial stratified heterogeneity (SSH). We propose a novel framework for integrating SAC and SSH into DB and MB. We do so by distinguishing the spatial population from the spatial sample. We show that spatial independence in a spatial population results in independence in a spatial sample, whereas SAC in a spatial population is reflected in a spatial sample if sampling distances are within the range of dependence; otherwise, SAC is absent in the spatial sample. Similarly, SSH in a population may or may not be inherited in data, and this depends on the sampling method. Thus, the population, sample, and inference constitute a so-called spatial statistic trinity (SST), providing a new framework for spatial statistics, including sampling and inference.

The current study evaluated the willingness to pay for ecosystem services with regard to assess benefit transfer among sub basins of Wei River. In order to achieve an improved environmental status in Wei River basin, a choice experiment survey was conducted with the perception regarding valuation of ecosystem services in the upper, middle and lower basin. A total of 900 households sampled respondents were interviewed in the entire river basin. Seven ecological attributes were selected in an arrangement with improvements in ecological conditions in choice a set. Welfare estimates were measured through conditional logit (CL) and random parameter logit (RPL) models. Outcomes of our study validated the diversity in the public preferences regarding valuation of selected ecological attributes in all three basins. Like, water quality level was relatively highly valued (i.e. 109.3 Yuan) by those who live in lower basin followed by inhabitants of middle basin (81.57 Yuan). With the addition of heterogeneity in tastes and preferences, relatively lower transfer errors were estimated in RPL model as compared to CL model. While transferring benefits from lower to upper basin, the estimated transfer errors were 35.37% and 7.06% of transfer errors were estimated from upper to middle basin and 19.30% were estimated from middle to lower basin in RPL model. While for the same conditions, the estimated transfer errors in CL model were 44.49%, 9.49% and 29.37% respectively. In the light of current outcomes, there are sufficient evidences to claim for transferability of benefits between upper, middle and lower basins.

Exploring the epidemiological characteristics could provide a basis for responding to imported cases abroad and to formulate prevention and control strategies in areas where COVID-19 is still spreading rapidly. Methods The number of confirmed cases, daily growth, incidence and length of time from the first reported case to the end of the local cases (i.e., non-overseas imported cases) were compared by spatial (geographical) and temporal classification and visualization of the development and changes of the epidemic situation by layers through maps. Results In the first wave, a total of 539 cases were reported in Sichuan, with an incidence rate of 0.6462/100,000. The closer to Hubei the population centres were, the more pronounced the epidemic was. The peak in Sichuan Province occurred in the second week. Eight weeks after the Wuhan lockdown, the health crisis had eased. The longest epidemic length at the city level in China (except Wuhan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong) was 53 days, with a median of 23 days. Spatial autocorrelation analysis of China showed positive spatial correlation (Moran's Index > 0, p < 0.05). Most countries outside China began to experience a rapid rise in infection rates 4 weeks after their first case. Some European countries experienced that rise earlier than the USA. The pandemic in Germany, Spain, Italy, and China took 28, 29, 34, and 18 days, respectively, to reach the peak of daily infections, after their daily increase of up to 20 cases. During this time, countries in the African region and Southeast Asian region were at an early stage of infections, those in the Eastern Mediterranean region and region of the Americas were in a rapid growth phase. Conclusions After the closure of the outbreak city, appropriate isolation and control measures in the next 8 weeks were key to control the outbreak, which reduced the peak value and length of the outbreak.

In addition, there is a gradual transition between climate zones, and no real dividing line exists. To explore the climate regionalization of the QDM, we focused on the identification of the transition zone rather than the exact location of the boundary between subtropical and temperate zones. Thus, we proposed a new workflow for climate regionalization based on the Geodetector-SVM model (a combination of Geodetector and support vector machines). First, we selected the spatial distribution data of six vegetation types (including typical subtropical and temperate vegetation) to represent the spatial distribution of climatic zones. Environmental factors (such as topography, temperature, precipitation, and soil) were used as explanatory variables for the spatial distribution of vegetation. Second, using the Geodetector-SVM model, the distribution characteristics and suitable environment of typical vegetation in different climatic zones are comprehensively explored. By analyzing the multiple boundaries between subtropical and temperate vegetation, the location of the transition zone of the QDM was identified. The results revealed the following: (1) The new workflow for climate regionalization based on the Geodetector-SVM model is powerful for the identification of the transition zone. The q-statistics are generally greater than 0.35, indicating that the transition zone between subtropical and temperate zones can highly reflect the character of the QDM; (2) From west to east, the transition zone mainly passes through the cities of Heishui County, Kang County, Liuba County, and Yichuan County and is approximately 30 km wide.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "CLASSIFICATION;CHINA;IDENTIFICATION;ZONES", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Science & Technology - Other Topics", "wos_categories": "Multidisciplinary Sciences"}

SDCS integrates a priori information including land cover, diurnal LSTs data, and spatial distribution characteristics of samples to improve the representativeness of multi-temporal measurements over heterogeneous surfaces. SDCS was applied to four varied study areas using simulated satellite data and was compared with four existing methods including random sampling, systematic sampling, land cover-based stratified sampling, and conditioned Latin hypercube (CLH) sampling. Results showed that SDCS could significantly improve the representativeness of samples with a limited sample size. In homogeneous surfaces with an LST standard deviation (SD) of less than 2 K, the root mean square error (RMSE) of diurnal LSTs estimated by SDCS was less than 0.3 K when using 0.20% of the total pixels. In moderate heterogeneous surfaces (LST SD less than 5 K), 0.32% of the total pixels were required to achieve RMSE less than 0.5 K. In extremely heterogeneous surfaces (LST SD > 6 K), 0.96% of the pixels were needed to achieve the same accuracy. Further, the representativeness of the samples selected by SDCS was stable in diurnal space with uncertainties of LST bias less than 0.27 K.

Because of drought conditions and fragile ecology, these regions cannot develop agriculture at the expense of the environment. Given the challenges of global warming, the green total factor productivity (GTFP), taking CO(2)emissions as an undesirable output, is an effective index for measuring the sustainability of agricultural development. Agricultural GTFP can be influenced by both internal production factors (labor force, machinery, land, agricultural plastic film, diesel, pesticide, and fertilizer) and external climate factors (temperature, precipitation, and sunshine duration). In this study, we used the Super-slacks-based measure (Super-SBM) model to measure agricultural GTFP during the period 2000-2016 at the regional level. Our results show that the average agricultural GTFP of most provinces and autonomous regions in arid and semi-arid regions underwent a fluctuating increase during the study period (2000-2016), and the fluctuation was caused by the production factors (input and output factors). To improve agricultural GTFP, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Gansu should reduce agricultural labor force input; Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, and Shanxi should decrease machinery input; Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Shanxi should reduce fertilizer input; Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Gansu, and Ningxia should reduce diesel input; Xinjiang and Gansu should decrease plastic film input; and Gansu, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia should cut pesticide input. Desirable output agricultural earnings should be increased in Qinghai and Tibet, and undesirable output (CO(2)emissions) should be reduced in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Gansu, and Shaanxi. Agricultural GTFP is influenced not only by internal production factors but also by external climate factors. To determine the influence of climate factors on GTFP in these provinces and autonomous regions, we used a Geographical Detector (Geodetector) model to analyze the influence of climate factors (temperature, precipitation, and sunshine duration) and identify the relationships between different climate factors and GTFP. We found that temperature played a significant role in the spatial heterogeneity of GTFP among provinces and autonomous regions in arid and semi-arid regions. For Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet, a suitable average annual temperature would be in the range of 7 degrees C-9 degrees C; for Gansu, Shanxi, and Ningxia, it would be 11 degrees C-13 degrees C; and for Shaanxi, it would be 15 degrees C-17 degrees C. Stable climatic conditions and more efficient production are prerequisites for the development of sustainable agriculture. Hence, in the agricultural production process, reducing the redundancy of input factors is the best way to reduce CO(2)emissions and to maintain temperatures, thereby improving the agricultural GTFP.The significance of this study is that it explores the impact of both internal production factors and external climatic factors on the development of sustainable agriculture in arid and semi-arid regions, identifying an effective way forward for the arid and semi-arid regions of Northwest China.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "climate change;agricultural GTFP;Super-slacks-based measure (Super-SBM) model;Geodetector;CO(2)emissions;arid regions;semi-arid regions;WATER-USE EFFICIENCY;RAINFALL HARVESTING SYSTEM;RIDGE-FURROW;CARBON EMISSIONS;PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH;ENERGY-CONSUMPTION;CROP PRODUCTIVITY;LOESS PLATEAU;GRAIN-YIELD;LAND-USE", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Ocean Univ China, Sch Econ, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Ocean Univ China, Inst Marine Dev, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Ocean Univ China, Sch Foreign Languages, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China\n[ 4 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China\n[ 5 ]‎ Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Environmental Sciences & Ecology", "wos_categories": "Environmental Sciences"}

Firstly, monitoring data of monthly rainfall, variations of reservoir water level, deformation of landslide surface and piles' head were preprocessed. The random deformation data were generated considering uncertainty of deformation monitoring data. Meanwhile, the deformation response of landslide-pile system is analyzed through studying the monitoring deformation data and random deformation data using the clustering algorithm. Finally, geographic detector technique was used to identify main triggering factors of landslide surface deformation and explore interaction types of any two factors. The uncertainty of monitoring data was used to identify the most important triggering factor. Influences of different error and uncertainty of monitoring data on the influence degrees of each factor were further discussed. The comparison with improved Apriori algorithm shows that the presented framework can intuitively measure influence degrees of each factor and analyze interaction types of any two factors. The main conclusions by studying Majiagou landslide indicate that the anti-slide performance and action range of piles gradually decrease with the increase of hydraulic cycle; the deterioration of geomaterials' properties are the most important triggering factor leading to the deformation of landslide-pile system and the degradation of piles' performance, supported by most random deformation groups.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Reservoir landslide-pile system;Deformation response;Triggering factors;Geographic detector technique;Uncertainty of monitoring data;MAJIAGOU LANDSLIDE;REGION", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ China Univ Geosci Wuhan, Fac Engn, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Engineering; Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Mathematics; Water Resources", "wos_categories": "Engineering, Environmental; Engineering, Civil; Environmental Sciences; Statistics & Probability; Water Resources"}

This scheme incorporates diverse remotely sensed surface parameters, e.g., leaf area index-LAI, the normalized difference vegetation index-NDVI, net radiation-Rn, and land surface temperature-LST. The LSHCs can be classified into three categories, namely homogeneous, moderately heterogeneous and highly heterogeneous based on the remotely sensed LAI data with a 30 m spatial resolution and the combination of normalized information entropy (S ') and coefficient of variation (CV). Based on the evaluation scheme, the spatial heterogeneity of land surface hydrothermal conditions at six typical flux observation stations in the Heihe River Basin during the vegetation growing season were evaluated. The evaluation results were consistent with the land surface type characteristics exhibited by Google Earth imagery and spatial heterogeneity assessed by high resolution remote sensing evapotranspiration data. Impact factors such as precipitation and irrigation events, spatial resolutions of remote sensing data, heterogeneity in the vertical direction, topography and sparse vegetation could also affect the evaluation results. For instance, short-term changes (precipitation and irrigation events) in the spatial heterogeneity of LSHCs can be diagnosed by energy factors, while long-term changes can be indicated by vegetation factors. The spatial heterogeneity of LSHCs decreases when decreasing the spatial resolution of remote sensing data.

We concluded that from 2000 to 2015 freshwater demand was approaching the limit of freshwater supply in the Yanhe watershed, with the freshwater demand continuously increasing. Due to the shortage of freshwater service, the deficit nodes and stop-flowing edges in the freshwater service flow network increased, and the network density decreased.

Therefore, modeling car availability in FFCS systems is particularly challenging. For these reasons, the research community has started to investigate the applicability of Machine Learning models to analyze FFCS usage data. This paper addresses the problem of predicting the short-term level of availability of the FFCS service in the short term. Specifically, it investigates the applicability of Machine Learning models to forecast the number of available car within a restricted urban area. It seeks the spatial and temporal contexts in which nonlinear ML models, trained on past usage data, are necessary to accurately predict car availability. Leveraging ML has shown to be particularly effective while considering highly dynamic urban contexts, where FFCS service usage is likely to suddenly and unexpectedly change. To tailor predictive models to the real FFCS data, we study also the influence of ML algorithm, prediction horizon, and characteristics of the neighborhood of the target area.

Our findings reported that in addition to socioeconomic factors, environmental factors also had significant impacts on healthcare resources inequalities at both global and local space-time scales. Globally, the personal economy was identified as the most significant explanatory factor. However, the temporal impacts of personal economy demonstrated a gradual decline, while the impacts of the regional economy and government investment showed a constant growth from 2002 to 2011. Spatially, geographical clustered regions for both hospital bed distributions and various hospital bed-covariates relationships were detected. Finally, the first spatiotemporal series of complete county-level hospital bed inequality maps in southwest China was produced.

The areas with high Cd in Guangxi soils were classified into non-mining areas and mining areas according to their potential Cd sources. The results show that the rich Cd content in the soils from the non-mining area of Guangxi was mainly derived from the soil type (q = 0.34), geological age (q = 0.27), rock type (q = 0.26) and geomorphic type (q = 0.20). Specifically, the Cd content was derived from the weathering and deposition processes of carbonatite from the Carboniferous system in the karst area. The high Cd content in the soils of the mining area of Guangxi was mainly derived from the area mined for mineral resources (q = 0.08) and rock type (q = 0.05). Specifically, the Cd content was derived from the mining of lead-zinc ores.

The generations of the epidemic spread are not well known, yet these are critical parameters to facilitate an understanding of the epidemic. A seafood wholesale market and Wuhan city, China, were recognized as the primary and secondary epidemic sources. Human movements nationwide from the two epidemic sources revealed the characteristics of the first-generation and second-generation spreads of the COVID-19 epidemic, as well as the potential third-generation spread.Methods: We used spatiotemporal data of COVID-19 cases in mainland China and two categories of location-based service (LBS) data of mobile devices from the primary and secondary epidemic sources to calculate Pearson correlation coefficient,r, and spatial stratified heterogeneity, q, statistics.Results: Two categories of device trajectories had generally significant correlations and determinant powers of the epidemic spread. Bothr and q statistics decreased with distance from the epidemic sources and their associations changed with time. At the beginning of the epidemic, the mixed first-generation and second-generation spreads appeared in most cities with confirmed cases. They strongly interacted to enhance the epidemic in Hubei province and the trend was also significant in the provinces adjacent to Hubei. The third-generation spread started in Wuhan from January 17-20, 2020, and in Hubei from January 23-24. No obvious third-generation spread was detected outside Hubei.Conclusions: The findings provide important foundations to quantify the effect of human movement on epidemic spread and inform ongoing control strategies. The spatiotemporal association between the epidemic spread and human movements from the primary and secondary epidemic sources indicates a transfer from second to third generations of the infection. Urgent control measures include preventing the potential third-generation spread in mainland China, eliminating it in Hubei, and reducing the interaction influence of first-generation and second-generation spreads.

However, the disparity between urban and rural areas in the risk of preterm birth (PTB) has yet to be elucidated. Considering geographic contexts as homogeneous or ignoring urban-rural differences cannot accurately reveal the disparities in the health effects of air pollution under different geographic contexts. The aims of this study were to examine the disparities in the risks of PTB in three different regions and five urban-rural types and to investigate the extent to which fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure during the entire pregnancy can explain the variations. Methods We collected data on 429,865 singleton newborns born in 2014 in Hubei Province, China, and divided Hubei Province into three regions. Spatial correlation methods were employed to measure the associations between the rate of PTB and air pollution using average annual indexes for the entire province and regions. A series of multilevel logistic models were conducted to examine disparities in the risks of PTB with decreases in urbanity and the effects of air pollution exposure on the occurrence of preterm births. Results The PM(2.5)concentration was significantly different across the regions. The eastern region had the most wide-ranged and serious level of pollution, whereas the levels in the middle and western regions weakened. The odds of PTB and air pollution exhibited a positive spatial correlation for the entire province and in the east (BiMoran's I = 0.106 and 0.697, respectively). Significant urban-rural disparities in the risks of PTB were noted in the east and middle regions, and the mean PM(2.5)exposure during the entire pregnancy was positively associated with PTB risk. However, in the west, the results showed weak differences in the risks of PTB among the five urban-rural types and an insignificant effect of PM(2.5)exposure. The direction of the effect of district/county-level income on PTB varied by region. Conclusions This study finds that air pollution exposure and PTB have significant and positive spatial relationships in areas with a serious air pollution burden. The risks of PTB in three regions of Hubei Province follow the same W-shaped pattern as urbanity decreases and rurality increases. High levels of air pollution exposure may be an important disadvantage for urban pregnant women in this setting.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Air pollution exposure;Preterm birth;Urban-rural disparity;Spatial correlation;Multilevel logistic model;FINE PARTICULATE MATTER;CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE;MATERNAL EXPOSURE;PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY;NITROGEN-DIOXIDE;CHILD HEALTH;CANCER-RISK;NEW-YORK;ASSOCIATION;WEIGHT", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, Beijing Key Lab Remote Sensing Environm & Digital, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, Tongji Med Coll, Tongji Hosp, Wuhan 430030, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health", "wos_categories": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"}

Markov chain models are effective prediction tools that are widely used to analyse drought class transitions by describing the temporal dependency of drought events. However, geophysical events or phenomena (such as drought events) can exhibit spatial effects resulting from spatial heterogeneity and/or dependency. This means that on the one hand the drought processes may vary over space, and on the other hand the state change of a drought event may not only depend on its previous state but also on the previous states of its neighbours, and it is thus unreasonable to directly apply Markov chain models without considering spatial effects. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework that considers spatial effects when employing drought class transition analysis. Three types of Markov chain models are introduced (traditional, local and spatial). To test for the existence of spatial effects, spatial clustering technology is selected to identify spatial heterogeneity, and aQstatistic is used to determine the existence of spatial dependency. Based on the results of these tests, a corresponding type of Markov chain models is then selected to analyse drought class transitions. Monthly rainfall time series data for Southwest China from 1951 to 2010 are employed in a case study, and the results show that spatial heterogeneity exists for both the 3- and 9-month SPI time series; however, the existence of spatial dependency is not confirmed.

These indices also had integrated effects on variations of TN and TP together with other indices such as Shannon diversity index, landscape shape index, largest patch index, and contagion index. The integrated effects were different in the wet and dry seasons because of different effects of flushing and dilution by rainwater and the heterogeneity in landscape patterns. The LWLI had a positive relationship to water quality in the areas with high ratio of urban areas, indicating that domestic wastewater can be a major source of N and P pollution.

The best measure of its impact is a population's PM2.5 exposure (PPM2.5E), an index that simultaneously considers PM2.5 concentrations and population spatial density. The spatiotemporal variation of PPM2.5E over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, which is the national capital region of China, was investigated using a Bayesian space-time model, and the influence patterns of the anthropic and geographical factors were identified using the GeoDetector model and Pearson correlation analysis.

The aim of this study is to address the space-time trends of the population-ageing rate (PAR), the number of medical resources per thousand residents (NMRTR) in mainland China in the past 10years, and to investigate the spatial and temporal matching between the PAR and NMRTR in mainland China.MethodsThe Bayesian space-time hierarchy model was employed to investigate the spatiotemporal variation of PAR and NMRTR in mainland China over the past 10years. Subsequently, a Bayesian Geo-Detector model was developed to evaluate the spatial and temporal matching levels between PAR and NMRTR at national level. The matching odds ratio (OR) index proposed in this paper was applied to measure the matching levels between the two terms in each provincial area.ResultsThe Chinese spatial and temporal matching q-statistic values between the PAR and three vital types of NMRTR were all less than 0.45. Only the spatial matching Bayesian q-statistic values between the PAR and the number of beds in hospital reached 0.42 (95% credible interval: 0.37, 0.48) nationwide. Chongqing and Guizhou located in southwest China had the highest spatial and temporal matching ORs, respectively, between the PAR and the three types of NMRTR. The spatial pattern of the spatial and temporal matching ORs between the PAR and NMRTR in mainland China exhibited distinct geographical features, but the geographical structure of the spatial matching differed from that of the temporal matching between the PAR and NMRTR.ConclusionThe spatial and temporal matching degrees between the PAR and NMRTR in mainland China were generally very low.

This study constructs a comprehensive index based on remote sensing called alpine grassland desertification index (AGDI) to monitor the areas and degree of desertification. The most relevant indicators of desertification, namely, vegetation fraction, aboveground biomass, soil moisture, and land surface temperature, were selected to establish AGDI.

Applying the geographical detector method, this paper also delved into the contributing factors that influenced the distribution based on the natural, social and economic data, such as the potential crop productivity, the average slope, the urbanization rate and the time cost to reach the nearest cities. The results indicate that the migration of the population from the rural areas into the cities, which was a result of rapid urbanization, did not change the original population distribution in rural China significantly. The rural population was still concentrated in the eastern plains, basins and deltas, and the North China Plain and Sichuan Basin still house the bulk of rural residents, but the population density of rural residents in the North China Plain and Sichuan Basin decreased from 1990 to 2010. The rural population in China tended to be distributed around the cities. Seventy-four percent of the rural population lived in an area within a 60-minute driving distance from the surrounding cities. The areas with dense rural population were basically consistent with the locations of the current major urban agglomerations in China.

The geographical detector model is a widely used technique for spatial stratified heterogeneity analysis. In the model, the spatial data discretization and spatial scale effects are fundamental issues, but they are generally determined by experience and lack accurate quantitative assessment in previous studies. To address this issue, an optimal parameters-based geographical detector (OPGD) model is developed for more accurate spatial analysis. The optimal parameters are explored as the best combination of spatial data discretization method, break number of spatial strata, and spatial scale parameter. In the study, the OPGD model is applied in three example cases with different types of spatial data, including spatial raster data, spatial point or areal statistical data, and spatial line segment data, and an R \"GD\" package is developed for computation. Results show that the parameter optimization process can further extract geographical characteristics and information contained in spatial explanatory variables in the geographical detector model. The improved model can be flexibly applied in both global and regional spatial analysis for various types of spatial data.

Evidence of the quantitative effects of determinants on MMR in China is limited. A better understanding of the spatiotemporal heterogeneity and quantifying determinants of the MMR would support evidence-based policymaking to sustainably reduce the MMR in China and other developing areas worldwide.Methods and findingsWe used data on MMR collected by the National Maternal and Child Health Surveillance System (NMCHSS) at the county level in China from 2010 to 2013. We employed a Bayesian space-time model to investigate the spatiotemporal trends in the MMR from 2010 to 2013. We used Bayesian multivariable regression and GeoDetector models to address 3 main ecological determinants of the MMR, including per capita income (PCI), the proportion of pregnant women who delivered in hospitals (PPWDH), and the proportion of pregnant women who had at least 5 check-ups (PPWFC). Among the 2,205 counties, there were 925 (42.0%) hotspot counties, located mostly in China's western and southwestern regions, with a higher MMR, and 764 (34.6%) coldspot counties with a lower MMR than the national level. China's westernmost regions, including Tibet and western Xinjiang, experienced a weak downward trend over the study period. Nationwide, medical intervention was the major determinant of the change in MMR. The MMR decreased by 1.787 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.424-2.142, p < 0.001) per 100,000 live births when PPWDH increased by 1% and decreased by 0.623 (95% CI 0.436-0.798, p < 0.001) per 100,000 live births when PPWFC increased by 1%. The major determinants for the MMR in China's western and southwestern regions were PCI and PPWFC, while that in China's eastern and southern coastlands was PCI. The MMR in western and southwestern regions decreased nonsignificantly by 1.111 (95% CI - 1.485-3.655, p = 0.20) per 100,000 live births when PCI in these regions increased by 1,000 Chinese Yuan and decreased by 1.686 (95% CI 1.275-2.090, p < 0.001) when PPWFC increased by 1%. Additionally, the western and southwestern regions showed the strongest interactive effects between different factors, in which the corresponding explanatory power of any 2 interacting factors reached up to greater than 80.0% (p < 0.001) for the MMR. Limitations of this study include a relatively short study period and lack of full coverage of eastern coastlands with especially low MMR.ConclusionsAlthough China has accomplished a 75% reduction in the MMR, spatial heterogeneity still exists. In this study, we have identified 925 (hotspot) high-risk counties, mostly located in western and southwestern regions, and among which 332 counties are experiencing a slower pace of decrease than the national downward trend. Nationally, medical intervention is the major determinant. The major determinants for the MMR in western and southwestern regions, which are developing areas, are PCI and PPWFC, while that in China's developed areas is PCI.

Findings: Here we present Biospytial, a modular open source knowledge engine designed to import, organise, analyse and visualise big spatial ecological datasets using the power of graph theory. The engine uses a hybrid graph-relational approach to store and access information. A graph data structure uses linkage relationships to build semantic structures represented as complex data structures stored in a graph database, while tabular and geospatial data are stored in an efficient spatial relational database system. We provide an application using information on species occurrences, their taxonomic classification and climatic datasets. We built a knowledge graph of the Tree of Life embedded in an environmental and geographical grid to perform an analysis on threatened species co-occurring with jaguars (Panthera onca). Conclusions: The Biospytial approach reduces the complexity of joining datasets using multiple tabular relations, while its scalable design eases the problem of merging datasets from different sources. Its modular design makes it possible to distribute several instances simultaneously, allowing fast and efficient handling of big ecological datasets.

Culex pipiens pallens and Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus are two medically concerned mosquito species in temperate and tropical areas, which serve as important disease-transmitting pests of a variety of diseases. The ongoing geographical expansion of these mosquitoes has brought an increasing threat to public health.RESULTS Based on mosquito occurrence records and high-resolution environmental layers, an ecological niche model was established to model their current and future potential distribution in China. Our model showed that the current suitable area for Cx. p. pallens is distributed in the central, eastern and northern parts of China, while Cx. p. quinquefasciatus is distributed in vast areas in southern China. Under future climate change scenarios, both species are predicted to expand their range to varying degrees and RCP 8.5 provides the largest expansion. Northward core shifts will occur in ranges of both species. Environmental variables which have significant impact on the distribution of mosquitoes were also revealed by our model.CONCLUSION Severe habitat expansion of vectors is likely to occur in the future 21st century. Our models mapped the high-risk areas and risk factors which needs to be paid attention.

The measurement and prediction of the HFMD incidence can be combined to improve the estimation accuracy, and provide a novel perspective to explore the spatiotemporal patterns and determinant factors of an HFMD epidemic. Methods In this study, we collected weekly HFMD incidence reports for a total of 138 districts in Shandong province, China, from May 2008 to March 2009. A Kalman filter was integrated with geographically weighted regression (GWR) to estimate the HFMD incidence. Spatiotemporal variation characteristics were explored and potential risk regions were identified, along with quantitatively evaluating the influence of meteorological and socioeconomic factors on the HFMD incidence. Results The results showed that the average error covariance of the estimated HFMD incidence by district was reduced from 0.3841 to 0.1846 compared to the measured incidence, indicating an overall improvement of over 50% in error reduction. Furthermore, three specific categories of potential risk regions of HFMD epidemics in Shandong were identified by the filter processing, with manifest filtering oscillations in the initial, local and long-term periods, respectively. Amongst meteorological and socioeconomic factors, the temperature and number of hospital beds per capita, respectively, were recognized as the dominant determinants that influence HFMD incidence variation. Conclusions The estimation accuracy of the HFMD incidence can be significantly improved by integrating a Kalman filter with GWR and the integration is effective for exploring spatiotemporal patterns and determinants of an HFMD epidemic. Our findings could help establish more accurate HFMD prevention and control strategies in Shandong. The present study demonstrates a novel approach to exploring spatiotemporal patterns and determinant factors of HFMD epidemics, and it can be easily extended to other regions and other infectious diseases similar to HFMD.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Hand;Foot and mouth disease;Kalman filter;Geographically weighted regression;Spatiotemporal pattern;Determinant factors;METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS;CHILDHOOD HAND;DATA ASSIMILATION;CLIMATE FACTORS;ENTEROVIRUS 71;AIR-POLLUTION;TIME-SERIES;CROP MODEL;CHINA;COEFFICIENTS", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Jiangxi Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Environm, Nanchang 330022, Jiangxi, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health", "wos_categories": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"}

Here, we explored the influence of environmental factors on STP content under different levels of soil erosion in the small watershed of Nanliao River, a tributary of Xiu River in the western part of Poyang Lake Plain in Jiangxi Province, China. Soil erosion ranged from 0 to 176.26 t hm(-2) a(-1) (15.41 t hm(-2) a(-1) on average) across the watershed in 2018, indicating a mild erosion level on the whole. The STP content varied between 0.06 and 1.19 g/kg (0.6 g/kg on average) with a coefficient of variation of 43.33%, indicating moderate variation. An exponential model with a small nugget effect (7.35%) and a small range (2.25 km) could estimate 86.5% of spatial variability in STP content. The STP content showed a strong spatial autocorrelation, and the soil rich in STP was mostly distributed along the Nanliao River.

Methods The species-specific primers were designed based on rDNA-ITS2 sequences of Anopheles (An. sinensis, An. lesteri, An. yatsushiroensis, An. kleini and An. belenrae) to improve the specificity and sensitivity of the multiplex PCR method to identify the Anopheles mosquito species. Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from 18 locations in 8 provinces (municipalities or autonomous regions) in China using light trap and entomological aspirator from 2013 to 2018. Those mosquitoes identified as members of An. hyrcanus group based on morphological characteristics were used for further analysis. The genomic DNA of individual mosquito was extracted, and the multiplex PCR assay was used to determine the species of An. hyrcanus group. For those mosquitoes without multiplex PCR products, the rDNA-ITS2 was amplified and sequenced, and the sequences were subjected to BLAST of the NCBI GenBank database to determine the species. Based on the results of this study and the review of 17 publications that identified An. sinensis using molecular biological methods in China, South Korea and the Far East of Russian, as well as the collected geographical location and climate data, the influence q value was calculated using the geo-detector software. The effects of geographical longitude, latitude, annual average temperature and rainfall on the distribution of An. sinensis were analyzed. Results The improved multiplex PCR method was able to simultaneously identify five members of the An. hyrcanus group based on the size of the amplified fragments as An. sinensis (490 bp), An. lesteri (313 bp), An. yatsushiroensis (216 bp), An. kleini (386 bp) and An. belenrae (165 bp). In this study, the species of 365 Anopheles mosquitoes were identified by multiplex PCR, including An. sinensis (n = 114, collected from Shaanxi, Anhui and Shandong), An. yatsushiroensis (n = 34), An. lesteri (n = 9), An. kleini (n = 181), An. belenrae (n = 5). The 22 individuals without acquiring amplified products were identified as An. kweiyangensis (n = 2), An. sineroides (n = 1), An. koreicus (n = 8), An. lindesayi (n = 7) and An. pattoni (n = 4) by rDNA-ITS2 sequencing. The geographic and ecological data were collected from 101 sites, including 80 sites with An. sinensis and 21 sites without An. sinensis distribution. The calculated q values were 0.592 0 for annual average temperature, 0.507 2 for latitude, 0.351 2 for longitude and 0.214 4 for annual average rainfall. The results indicate that the most significant factor affecting the distribution of An. sinensis is temperature, followed by latitude. Comprehensive analysis of the impact of latitude and annual average temperature on the distribution of Anopheles revealed that the annual average temperature of 10 ℃ could be used as the reference to determine the northern boundary of An. sinensis distribution in China. An. sinensis was distributed in the entire provinces (municipalities or autonomous regions) of Yunnan, Guizhou, Chongqing, Henan, Shandong, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, and the southern parts of the Tibet, Sichuan, Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Beijing and Liaoning. Conclusion The improved multiplex PCR assay used to identify An. hyrcanus group is fast, simple and reliable. The annual average temperature of 10 ℃ could be used as reference to determine the northern boundary for the geographical distribution of An. sinensis in China, and the distribution range is smaller than that in the previously recorded document.", "abstract_ch": "目的改进赫坎按蚊种团部分成员种的多重PCR鉴别方法,鉴别赫坎按蚊种团中的中华按蚊,研究我国中华按蚊的区系分布及其影响因素。方法依据赫坎按蚊种团成员种中华按蚊、八代按蚊、雷氏按蚊、比伦按蚊和克莱按蚊的核糖体DNA内转录间隔区2(rDNA-ITS2)序列差异设计种特异引物,改进多重PCR分子鉴别方法。2013-2018年,在我国8个省(直辖市、自治区)共18个地点,以诱虫灯和人工吸取相结合的方法采集按蚊,依据形态特征初步鉴定为赫坎按蚊种团的成员种。提取单只蚊虫基因组DNA,使用改进的多重PCR方法鉴定种类。对多重PCR法无扩增产物的个体分析rDNA-ITS2序列,在GenBank上进行BLAST比对,确定其种类。查找我国以及韩国和俄罗斯远东地区用分子特征鉴别为中华按蚊的文献,结合本研究结果,汇总中华按蚊采集地的地理位置和气候数据,使用地理探测器模型计算影响决定力q值,分析经度、纬度、年平均气温和年平均降雨量对中华按蚊分布的影响。结果改进的多重PCR法一次扩增即可依据扩增片段大小鉴别赫坎按蚊种团的5个成员种:中华按蚊(490 bp)、雷氏按蚊(313 bp)、八代按蚊(216 bp)、克莱按蚊(386 bp)和比伦按蚊(165 bp)。在我国18个采集点共捕获赫坎按蚊种团按蚊365只,多重PCR鉴别为中华按蚊114只(来自陕西、安徽与山东的采集点)、八代按蚊34只、雷氏按蚊9只、克莱按蚊181只和比伦按蚊5只。22只多重PCR无扩增产物的蚊虫中,经rDNA-ITS2序列分析鉴定为贵阳按蚊2只、类中华按蚊1只、朝鲜按蚊8只、林氏按蚊7只和帕氏按蚊4只。获取用分子特征鉴别为中华按蚊的文献17篇,共汇总了101个采集地信息,其中有中华按蚊分布的采集点80个,无中华按蚊分布的21个地点。地理探测器软件计算获得的q值,从大到小依次为0.592 0(年平均气温)、0.507 2(纬度)、0.351 2(经度)和0.214 4(年平均降雨量)。中华按蚊的分布与年平均气温关系最为密切,其次是纬度。综合分析分布地的纬度和年平均温度等结果显示,年平均气温10 ℃可以作为划分中华按蚊在我国分布北界线的依据。我国中华按蚊的分布范围包括云南、贵州、重庆、河南、山东、天津、江苏、安徽、湖北、浙江、上海、福建、江西、广西、广东、海南等省(直辖市、自治区)及台湾、香港、澳门特别行政区的全境,以及西藏、四川、甘肃、陕西、山西、河北、北京、辽宁等省(直辖市、自治区)的南部部分地区。结论改进的赫坎按蚊种团多重PCR分子鉴定方法快速简单、客观可靠。综合分析显示划分中华按蚊在我国分布北界线的依据是年平均气温10 ℃线,中华按蚊在我国的分布应小于之前记载的范围。", "keywords_en": "Hyrcanus group; Anopheles sinensis complex; Molecular identification; Faunal distribution", "keywords_ch": "赫坎按蚊种团; 中华按蚊复合体; 分子鉴别; 区系分布", "address_en": "Peng Heng,Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology,Navy Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.Li Xiangyu,Department of Medical Microbiology and Parasitology,Navy Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.Chen Hanming,Department of Tropical Diseases,Navy Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.Chen Huiying,Department of Tropical Diseases,Navy Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.Wang Yan,Department of Tropical Diseases,Navy Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.Ma Yajun,Department of Tropical Diseases,Navy Medical University, Shanghai 200433, China.Li Jixu,Division of Vectors and Parasitic Diseases,Yanbian Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Yanji, Jilin 133001, China.Yang Zhenzhou,Institute of Disease Control and Prevention,People's Liberation Army of China, Beijing 100071, China.", "address_ch": "彭恒,中国人民解放军海军军医大学病原生物学教研室, 上海 200433, 中国.李翔宇,中国人民解放军海军军医大学病原生物学教研室, 上海 200433, 中国.陈翰明,中国人民解放军海军军医大学热带病学教研室, 上海 200433, 中国.陈辉莹,中国人民解放军海军军医大学热带病学教研室, 上海 200433, 中国.王琰,中国人民解放军海军军医大学热带病学教研室, 上海 200433, 中国.马雅军,中国人民解放军海军军医大学热带病学教研室, 上海 200433, 中国.李基旭,吉林省延边州疾病预防控制中心病媒与寄生虫病防治科, 延吉, 吉林 133001, 中国.杨振洲,中国人民解放军疾病预防控制中心, 北京 100071, 中国.", "research_areas": "General & Internal Medicine", "wos_categories": ""}

The objective of this study was to map the spatial-temporal distribution of HFMD incidence and quantify the long-term effects of temperature fluctuations on HFMD incidence in children. HFMD cases in children under five, from January 2009 to December 2013, in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei provinces of China, were used in this study. The GeoDetector and Bayesian space-time hierarchy models were employed to explore the spatial-temporal association between temperature fluctuations and HFMD incidence. The results indicate that HFMD incidence had significant spatial stratified heterogeneity (GeoDetector q-statistic = 0.83, p < 0.05), and that areas with higher risk mainly appeared in metropolises and their adjacent regions. HFMD transmission was negatively associated with temperature fluctuations. A 1 degrees C increase in the standard deviation of maximum and minimum temperatures was associated with decreases of 8.22% and 11.87% in the risk of HFMD incidence, respectively. The study suggests that large temperature fluctuations affect virus growth or multiplication, thereby inhibiting the activity of the virus and potentially even leading to its extinction, and consequently affecting the spatial-temporal distribution of HFMD.

The Q test is a traditional method to assess heterogeneity; however, because it does not have an intuitive interpretation for clinicians and often has low statistical power, many meta-analysts alter to use some measures, such as the I-2 statistic, to quantify the extent of heterogeneity. This article aims at providing a summary of available tools to assess heterogeneity and comparing their performance.Methods: We reviewed four heterogeneity measures (I-2, (R) over cap (I), (R) over cap (M), and (R) over cap (b)) and illustrated how they could be treated as test statistics like the Q statistic. These measures were compared with respect to statistical power based on simulations driven by three real-data examples. The pairwise agreement among the four measures was also evaluated using Cohen's. coefficient.Results: Generally, (R) over cap (I) was slightly more powerful than the Q test, while its type I error rate might be slightly inflated. The power of I-2 was fairly close to that of Q. The (R) over cap (M) and (R) over cap (b) statistics might have low powers in some cases. Because the differences between the powers of I-2, (R) over cap (I), and Q were often tiny, meta-analysts might not expect I-2 and (R) over cap (I) to yield significant heterogeneity if the Q test failed to do so. In addition, I-2 and (R) over cap (I) had fairly good agreement based on the simulated meta-analyses, but all other pairs of heterogeneity measures generally had poor agreement.Conclusion: The I-2 and (R) over cap (I) statistics are recommended for measuring heterogeneity. Meta-analysts should use the heterogeneity measures as descriptive statistics which have intuitive interpretations from the clinical perspective, instead of determining the significance of heterogeneity simply based on their magnitudes.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "heterogeneity;I-2 statistic;meta-analysis;statistical power;I-2;TESTS", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Florida State Univ, Dept Stat, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; General & Internal Medicine", "wos_categories": "Health Care Sciences & Services; Medical Informatics; Medicine, General & Internal"}

The combination analysis across spatial resolutions, which is rare, helps explore the comprehensive relationship between urban fragmentation and CO2 emissions. This study compared the relationships between urban form fragmentation and CO2 emissions in an urban system through the analytic framework composed of the Pearson correlation analysis, geographically weighted regression (GWR), and geographical detector methods with the use of multi-source data to construct the CO2 emissions maps. As the result, there was less fragmentation with a 500-m spatial resolution (R-500m) than with a 30-m spatial resolution (R-30m). In terms of the GWR analysis, the coarse resolution resulted in: 1) positive coefficients of fragmentation metric becoming negative, and 2) greater absolute values of negative coefficients. As to the results of Geographical detector, single factor impact powers and interactions among fragmentation factors showed a weakening effect at R(30)m but a strengthening and weakening effect at R-500m. However, there were common results observed in low-fragmented areas across different scales. That is, in low-fragmented mixed-function areas and industrial areas, the more fragmented the area was, the less the CO2 emission there would be. However, in low-fragmented residential, administrative and public service areas, the more fragmented the area was, the higher the CO2 emission there would be. Therefore, the government should disperse the mixed function zones and industrial parcels with diverse types of land, and build the contiguous residential and public service land in the low fragmentation area of urban system.

Additionally, this paper explores the impacts of various factors on the spatio-temporal dynamics of DCFG demand using the Geo-Detector method. The results demonstrate that: (1) the temporal dynamics of DCFG demand can be divided into three stages of slow growth, rapid growth, and high-level stability, and the relative level of DCFG demand in the whole animal husbandry tends to decline; (2) at the regional and national levels, the spatial concentration of high DCFG demand has intensified; in particular, North China was the region where the largest demand for DCFG was localized and was increasing at the highest rate; (3) based on the hot spot analysis of provincial DCFG demand, the high and low demand provinces of DCFG have sharp characteristic contrast from north to south China; (4) the spatio-temporal dynamics of DCFG demand in China were essentially co-affected by the four groups of factors (e.g., resource endowment, feeding scale, feeding technology, and market environment), of which resource endowment and feeding scale were the dominant factors. Therefore, in the future, dairy cow feeding in China should promote grain-saving feeding technology, improve the utilization of forage, expand large-scale feeding, and create a good market environment to ensure the reasonable development and sustainability of DCFG demand.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "dairy cow feed grain (DCFG);spatio-temporal;feed grain conversion ratio;China;FOOD", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Shaanxi Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Tourism, Xian 710119, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology", "wos_categories": "Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies"}

Based on the scales of provincial,urban agglomeration and city,this paper used GDI,ESDA methods to analyze the spatio-temporal differences of quality medical resources in China from 2006 to 2017, and identified the key factors influencing the distribution of quality medical resources in different scales with the Geographical Detector method. The results show that: 1) From 2006 to 2017, the level of quality medical resources in China tends to be improved, and regional differences narrow,and with the reduction of scale,differences gradually expand. Among them,the degree of difference increases with the reduction of urban agglomeration level, but decreases with the reduction of city size. 2) The spatial agglomeration degree of quality medical resources is different at different scales,that is,the larger scale,higher the agglomeration degree of quality medical resources.

(2) The distribution of ESV over the years showed a pattern of \"low in the center, while high at the edge; high in the south, but low in the north\". The areas with high values were distributed in the Qinling Mountains and the Ziwuling Mountains, and those with low values were concentrated in the Guanzhong Plain. The spatial changes in the ESV are more obvious. The whole province is basically covered by negative values. The high- value areas are less concentrated and concentrated in Northern Shaanxi.

(3) Economic factors have the greatest impact on the ESV, with the strongest interpretation, followed by social factors, and natural factors contribute the least to the interpretation of ecosystem services. (4) The spatial intensity of the effects of various dominant factors on the ESV is different. The land reclamation rate is characterized by a gradual decline from south to north. The per capita GDP gradually increases from south to north, and the population density increases from northeast to southwest. The land reclamation rate, per capita GDP, and population density are all negatively correlated with ecosystem services.

This study shows that the development of secondary vocational education in China followed an inverted \"U\" trend from 2000 to 2016,and the geographical concentration of students in the provincial level is gradually increasing.The provinces with large-scale secondary vocational education include Guangdong Province,Henan Province,and Shandong Province.The development of secondary vocational education in more than one-third of the provinces in China is characterized by small scale and slow growth,as seen in Beijing,Tianjin,Shanghai,Fujian,Hubei,Shaanxi,Shanxi and Northeast China,while the \"growth\" provinces are all distributed in southern China,including Anhui,Jiangxi,Hunan,Guangdong,Guangxi,Yunnan,Guizhou,Sichuan,etc.From the perspective of spatial relationship,there is a significant spatial autocorrelation between the level and growth of secondary vocational education from 2000 to 2016,but the degree of spatial agglomeration has declined;this indicates that the spatial balance of secondary vocational education is constantly improving.In addition,the overall level of secondary vocational education shows a trend of \"moving south.\" The hotspots have moved from North China to Southeast,Central,and South China.Shandong,Henan,and Anhui provinces are always included as hotspots of secondary vocational education.The hotspots of secondary vocational education growth are mainly distributed in the western region,and show a transfer process from northwest to southwest.Tibet is always in a hotspot of growth.The main factors influencing this pattern of change are the population of school-age children and secondary vocational education development conditions,while the role of regional economic development level is relatively small.The interaction between different factors significantly affects the changes in the spatial pattern of secondary vocational education,mainly through interactions between the number of junior high school graduates and other factors.", "abstract_ch": "基于20002016年中国大陆31个省区中等职业教育发展相关统计数据,采用中等职业教育地理集中度、空间自相关分析和地理探测器等方法,探讨了2000年以来中国中等职业教育水平时空分异、空间集聚格局及其影响因素。结果表明:1)20002016年中国中等职业教育发展呈倒U型变化趋势,地理集中度逐渐提高,省域中等职业教育发展以缩减型为主;2)中等职业教育水平及增长呈正空间自相关,空间集聚特征明显,总体呈西进南移空间格局,西部是中等职业教育增长热点区,区域均衡性明显提升;3)中等职业教育空间集聚格局的主要影响因素是适龄教育人口和中等职业教育发展条件,经济因素影响相对较弱,不同影响因子交互作用显著,初中毕业生数是主导交互因子,城镇登记失业率、城镇化率逐渐成为次主导交互因子。", "keywords_en": "secondary vocational education; spatial agglomeration; spatial autocorrelation; geodetector; geographies of education; China", "keywords_ch": "中等职业教育; 空间集聚; 空间自相关; 地理探测器; 教育地理学; 中国", "address_en": "Wang Hui,School of geography and tourism,Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710119, China.Yan Junping,School of geography and tourism,Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710119, China.Peng Bangwen,School of Economics and Management,Northwest University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710127, China.Liu Dongmei,School of Economics and Management,Xi'an Aeronautical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710077, China.Lian Lijuan,Sanya Aviation and Tourism College, Sanya, Hainan 572000, China.", "address_ch": "王辉,陕西师范大学地理科学与旅游学院, 西安, 陕西 710119, 中国.延军平,陕西师范大学地理科学与旅游学院, 西安, 陕西 710119, 中国.彭邦文,西北大学经济管理学院, 西安, 陕西 710127, 中国.刘冬梅,西安航空学院经济管理学院, 西安, 陕西 710077, 中国.连丽娟,三亚航空旅游职业学院, 三亚, 海南 572000, 中国.", "research_areas": "Education & Educational Research", "wos_categories": ""}

This study tests this effect under controlled conditions quantified by geostatistical and fractal indices. When four commonly adopted tillage practices, namely, artificial backhoe (AB), artificial digging (AD), contour tillage (CT), and linear slope (CK), were prepared on soil surfaces at 2 x 1 x 0.5 m soil pans at 5 degrees, 10 degrees, or 20 degrees slope gradients, artificial rainfall with an intensity of 60 or 90 mm h(-1) was applied to it. Measurements of the difference in elevation points of the surface profiles were taken before rainfall and after rainfall events for sheet erosion. Tillage practices had a relationship with fractal indices that the surface treated with CT exhibited the biggest fractal dimension D value, followed by the surfaces AD, AB, and CK. Surfaces under a stronger rainfall tended to have a greater D value. Tillage treatments affected anisotropy differently and the surface CT had the strongest effect on anisotropy, followed by the surfaces AD, AB, and CK. A steeper surface would have less effect on anisotropy. Since the surface CT had the strongest effect on spatial variability or the weakest spatial autocorrelation, it had the smallest effect on runoff and sediment yield.

The essence of extreme poverty is absolute poverty, where individuals experience long- term shortages of essential resources or suffer from harsh environment. Extreme poverty is the priority for poverty alleviation and the tough row to hoe. We select the major poverty influencing factors from natural and social factors to build an evaluation index system based on spatial poverty and related theories. First, we use Pearson correlation analysis to differentiate poverty impoverishing and alleviation factors. Then, we use GIS and back propagating neural networks to define a natural impoverishing index (NII) and social economic poverty alleviation index (SEPAI), respectively, at provincial, municipal, and county levels. We then calculate a poverty pressure index (PPI) at provincial, municipal, and county levels by combining NII and SEPAI, and explore poverty spatial characteristics. We used the flexible spatial scanning statistical method to identify the severely impoverished counties among the poverty- stricken counties with PPI>1.63, which had higher poverty rate and difficulty in poverty alleviation. Finally, we diagnose dominant factors that differentiate severely impoverished counties, and identify the dynamic mechanism of regional extreme poverty differentiation using the geodetector model. Besides, we construct a theoretical basis for anti- poverty in rural China. The results show that NII and PPI spatial distributions are highly consistent at provincial, municipal, and county levels, with a significant distribution pattern: high in eastern China and low in western China. In contrast, SEPAI has relatively low spatial consistency at provincial, municipal, and county levels. The PPI poverty distribution pattern tends toward large dispersion, small aggregation dividing across the Heihe-Bose Line. A total of 655 poverty- stricken counties were identified, mainly distributed in major ecologically functional and agricultural production areas in China. High risk areas identified by spatial scanning are mainly distributed in the northwest, southwest minority, and border areas. We also identified 208 severely impoverished counties, mostly located in inter-provincial fringe areas.

With the development of multi-centralized Chinese cities, the gravity model must be validated because several relevant external conditions have changed. The purpose of this study is to validate Huff's Gravity Model using an individual mobile trajectory of mobile communication user in 2015. We follow Huff's two-step validation method: variable validation and parameter correction. Our main conclusions are as follows. First, attractions of commercial and employment centres conform to the law of the gravity model in which the attraction is proportional to the scale of a centre and inversely proportional to the distance from a centre. Second, in the spatial scale of Shanghai central city with spatial units in a 200-m grid, the mean distance exponent for commercial centres is 2.5 and that for employment centres is 3.0. The distance decay for commuting is greater than that for shopping trips, which means commuting is more sensitive to distance. Third, the gravity model can be used to predict the influence areas of adjusted commercial and employment centres based on validated variables and corrected parameters. Our results indicate that the prediction accuracies can reach 78.5% and 71.9% for the commercial and employment centres, respectively. The prediction accuracy for employment centres is slightly lower. This is because the attraction of employment centres is influenced not only by distance but also by factors such as family and housing prices, which will affect the prediction results. Lastly, in this study, we verify the spatial stratified heterogeneity of distance decay and determine that the distance exponent is not a unique constant because it has different values in different areas. Factors such as accessibility, distance to each centre, distance to a subway station and population density will affect distance decay.", "abstract_ch": "长期以来由于规模变量、距离衰减系数取值缺乏依据,引力模型在城市研究中的应用容易受到质疑,加之中国城市的多中心化使得模型应用的外部条件发生改变,模型验证工作的必要性再次显现。本文使用2015年移动通信用户的个体移动轨迹数据,使用Huff当年的验证方法,通过变量检验、参数校正两个步骤,验证Huff的引力模型。研究发现:①城市内部商业中心和就业中心的吸引力与中心的规模呈正比,与距中心的距离呈反比,符合引力模型规律。②在上海中心城区空间尺度、200 m网格空间单元下,商业中心吸引力的距离衰减系数平均值为2.5,就业中心吸引力的距离衰减系数平均值为3.0,表明居民就业通勤对距离更加敏感,距离衰减比购物出行更加显著。③经变量检验、参数校正后的引力模型可用于对商业中心、就业中心优化调整后的势力范围进行预测,预测准确率可分别达到78.5%和71.9%。就业中心势力范围预测准确性略低,这是由于就业中心吸引力衰减除受距离影响外,还受家庭、房价等因素影响,会对预测结果产生扰动。最后,研究还证实了距离衰减系数存在空间分层异质性:距离衰减系数不是唯一值,受道路可达性、至就业(商业)中心距离、至地铁站距离、人口密度影响,不同地区的距离衰减系数存在较显著差异。", "keywords_en": "gravity model; multi-centre; model validation; distance decay; spatial stratified heterogeneity; individual mobile trajectory", "keywords_ch": "引力模型; 多中心; 模型验证; 距离衰减; 空间分层异质性; 个体移动轨迹", "address_en": "Ding Liang,College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310014, China.Niu Xinyi,College of Architecture and Urban Planning, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China.Song Xiaodong,College of Architecture and Urban Planning, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China.", "address_ch": "丁亮,浙江工业大学建筑工程学院, 杭州, 浙江 310014, 中国.钮心毅,同济大学建筑与城市规划学院, 上海 200092, 中国.宋小冬,同济大学建筑与城市规划学院, 上海 200092, 中国.", "research_areas": "Business & Economics", "wos_categories": ""}

The k-nearest neighbor IDW (kAIDW) algorithm can take both spatial correlation and heterogeneity into account simultaneously without the needs of parameters input for users. Firstly, kAIDW sets the classification threshold adaptively for each sample point according to the statistical characteristics of the sample data and then divides the reference points into high, medium and low categories. Secondly, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is used to determine the category of the interpolation point. According to the classification result, different weight adjustment coefficients are adaptively determined for the first-order neighboring samples of the point to be interpolated. Finally, an IDW interpolation algorithm model integrating spatial correlation and heterogeneity is constructed.In order to validate the effectiveness of the algorithm, two different practical applications are adopted.

Meanwhile, agricultural production, serving as the primary stage of biobased products, is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nutrient releases. Environmental impacts of agricultural production influenced by farming practices, soil properties, and climate conditions, are often site-specific and time dependent. Although assessing spatially and temporally explicit environmental releases and impacts are required to inform a sustainable trajectory for agricultural production, such analyses are largely lacking. This study provides site-specific analysis of on-farm and supply chain emissions from corn production to demonstrate the spatio-temporal variability of environmental impacts in the U.S. Midwest states. Using process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) and the physically-based Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agroecosystem model, we estimated county-level life cycle environmental release inventories from corn production in 12 U.S. Midwest states for the period of 2000-2008. Based on the Tool for Reduction and Assessment of Chemicals and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI) impact assessment model, we quantified the corresponding life cycle global warming (GW), eutrophication (EU) and acidification (AD) impacts of corn. The results show that life cycle GW, EU and AD of corn production varied by factors of 4.2, 83.7 and 10.6, respectively, across the Midwest counties over the nine-year span (2000-2008). Life cycle GWimpacts of producing 1 kg of corn ranged from -6.4 in Franklin County, Illinois to 20.2 kg CO2-eq. in Perkins County, South Dakota. The life cycle EU impacts also spanned over a wide range of 0.99 g in Morton County, Kansas to 82.9 g N-eq. in Leelanau County, Michigan, whereas life cycle AD impacts ranged from 1.3 in Clermont County, Ohio to 100.7 g SO2-eq. in Perkins County, South Dakota. Moreover, trade-offs existed among life cycle GW, EU and AD impact categories for corn production. The spatial variation analyses showed that key contributors were the different soil types, precipitation, elevation and the amounts of fertilizers applied. These findings provided critical insight into spatio-temporal variations of life cycle environmental impacts of corn production and identified spatial hotspots and top contributors for improving environmental performances of corn production.

The spatial analysis answers the research question - in which regions(s) young Americans are even less likely to have a car. The results highlighted the Northeast states for the young American's extra-lower vehicle ownership if the influences of all other factors are held constant. The cost of living and availability of transportation alternatives are possible reasons. Further, this study built separate models for young adults (25-34 years old) and three older age groups. The vehicle ownership correlates within the young adults are found to be generally consistent with the correlates among all adults. Among young adults, vehicle ownership is still significantly related to their gender, educational attainment, employment status, household characteristics, and travel demand. However, young adults' vehicle ownership seems to be less sensitive to household income than mid-age adults' (35-44 years old), perhaps because young people may not perceive financial stress such as child support and mortgage.

The entropy value method is adopted to determine the index weight. Cluster analysis is performed and the spatial-temporal pattern and evolution laws of urban tourism competitiveness among city agglomerations in the Guanzhong Plain are analyzed and the geographic detector utilized to discuss the influencing factors. Results show that the spatial gradient difference of urban tourism competitiveness of agglomerations in the Guanzhong Plain is significant. In 2010, it presented the characteristic of 'the high and middle levels having a zonal distribution from east to west, and the low level was distributed along the north and south wings'. In 2017, the characteristic of 'polarization' became highly prominent, that is, the scope of high-level and low-level cities expanded and the scope of medium-level cities decreased. Urban tourism competitiveness in city agglomerations across the Guanzhong Plain exhibited a trend of 'strengthening in the east, weakening in the west'. The competitiveness of resources and management shifted aggressively and supporting factors competitiveness underwent a slight change. The urban tourism competitiveness of city agglomerations in the Guanzhong Plain is generally low, while the urban tourism competitiveness of Xi'an had an absolute advantage in city agglomerations of the Guanzhong Plain. According to the cluster analysis results, resources and management competitiveness, supporting factors competitiveness, demand conditions competitiveness, situational conditions competitiveness and urban tourism competitiveness of Xi'an in 2010 and 2017 were all at an extremely high level, which was relatively higher than the index values of other cities in the city agglomerations of the Guanzhong Plain.

Current literature lacks systematical research to consider the impacts of panel data and spatial correlation issue in examining the economic effects of transportation investment. To fill this gap, this study collects provincial panel data in China from 1997 to 2015 to evaluate multi-level temporal and spatial effects of transportation investment on economic growth by using spatial panel data analysis. Results show that transportation investment leads to significant and positive effects on growth and spatial concentration of economic activities, but these results vary significantly depending on the temporal and spatial characteristics of each province.

Profitability is mainly related to the demographic features of vendors, their business expenses, and payment schemes. It is also related to broader socioeconomic factors at the district level, including local GDP, average income, urban infrastructure, and number of residential neighborhoods. The characteristics of vendors and their businesses have a more significant relationship with business profit than district socio-economic factors.

The frequency distribution of junction angles is less influenced by the post-formational modification processes than valley density and cross-section and can be accurately extracted from low resolution data. We first analyzed the association between the junction angles and environmental factors on Earth.

Various infectious arbovirus diseases can be transmitted by Ae. aegypti. With ongoing global climate change, we are facing an increasing public health threat from the rapid spread of disease vectors into wider geographical areas. To better understand the current ecological niche range and possible future expansion of Ae. aegypti, an ecological niche modelling approach was adopted to predict its current and future potential habitat in Taiwan, China. RESULTS Based on observed occurrence records and environmental layers reflecting climate and land-use conditions, predictions with a high resolution of 30 arcsec (approx. 1 x 1 km) were made by our model. Ae. aegypti was predicted to expand its habitat in varying degrees out of its current niche range under different climate scenarios for the future 21st century. Winter temperature and dry season precipitation were considered as important predictors among climate variables. Croplands, pasture, forested lands and urban lands were important land-use variables. CONCLUSION Ae. aegypti is expected to establish new habitats out of its current niche range under the trend of global climate change. The extent of habitat expansion varies under different climate scenarios. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent its expansion to a broader scale.

The spatial pattern was formed under the influence of water pollution in the historical period. 1996, 1997, and 1998 have the strongest linear or nonlinear effect on the EC mortality rate in 2004, in which the Pearson correlation coefficient and the q-statistic were the highest, 0.79 and 0.89, respectively. Rapid industrialization in the past 20 years has caused environmental problems and poses related health risks. The study indicated that the current EC mortality rate was mainly caused by water pollution from the previous 8 years.

In 2016, four periods Landsat 8 OLI_TIRS images, relevant climatological parameters data (air temperature, air relative humidity, wind velocity and accumulated temperature), land cover type data and soil data were selected as proxies. In order to quantify the explanatory power for NDVI spatial and temporal distribution in the southern edge of Dunhuang City and northern side of the Mingsha Mountain, the geographical detector model was used to explain the potential influences of factors versus the spatial distribution of NDVI, and each explanatory variable's relative importance can be calculated. The factor detector results disclose that the spatial distribution of NDVI is primarily dominated by land cover type. The risk detector results show that, high NDVI region is located within woodland. The mean value of NDVI displays an increase and then decrease trend with air temperature increase. With the increase of wind velocity and decrease of air relative humidity, the NDVI value shows a decrease trend. The interactive q values between the two factors are higher than any q value of separated factors. Results also indicate that the strongest interactive effects of NDVI are different in distinct seasons.

Previous studies have indicated that lung cancer incidence exhibits remarkable spatial heterogeneity, and lung cancer is related to outdoor air pollution. However, the non-linear spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence in China remains unclear.MethodsIn this study, the relationships between the lung cancer incidence of males and females from 207 counties in China in 2013 with annual concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O-3 were analysed. GeoDetector q statistic was used for examining the non-linear spatial association between outdoor air pollution and incidence of lung cancer.ResultsAn apparent spatial and population gender heterogeneity was found in the spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence. Among the six selected pollutants, SO2 has the greatest influence on lung cancer (q=0.154 in females) in north China. In the south, each selected pollutant has a significant impact on males or females, and the mean q value in the south is 0.181, which is bigger than that in the north (q=0.154). In addition, the pollutants have evident non-linear interaction effects on lung cancer. In north China, the interaction between SO2 and PM2.5 is the dominant interaction, with q values of 0.207 in males and 0.334 in females. In the south, the dominant interactive factors are between SO2 and O-3 in males and between SO2 and CO in females, with q values of 0.45, 0.232 respectively. Smoking is a substantial contributor to lung cancer among men, either in South or North China, with q value of 0.143 and 0.129 respectively, and the interaction between smoking and air pollutants increases this risk.ConclusionsThis study implies that the influence of SO2 and PM2.5 on lung cancer should be focused on in north China, and in the south, the impact of O-3 and CO as well as their interaction with SO2 need to be paid more attention.

Using Geographical Detector, a new spatial statistical approach, individual and interactive influences of natural factors on vegetation NDVI changes were quantified for the Sichuan province. The optimal characteristics of key natural factors that are beneficial to vegetation growth were determined. The vegetation cover in Sichuan for 2000 and 2015 is good overall; areas with upper-intermediate and high vegetation cover account for more than 88% of the total area. Regions with an NDVI higher than 0.4 are noticeably transformed; regions with upper intermediate vegetation cover (NDVI from 0.4 to 0.8) tend to decrease significantly, whereas regions with high vegetation cover (NDVI>0.8) tend to increase significantly. Spatiotemporal variation in vegetation cover is very significant. Regions with high vegetation cover are distributed in the northeast part of the Sichuan Basin and on the northwestern Sichuan Plateau, whereas regions with low vegetation cover are distributed in urban agglomerative regions in the central part of the Sichuan Basin. Soil types, elevation, and annual mean temperature can satisfactorily account for vegetation changes. Natural factors have an interactive influence on NDVI. The synergistic effect of natural factors is manifested as mutual enhancement and nonlinear enhancement, and the interaction of two natural factors strengthens the influence of each individual natural factor.

Second, for the sake of designing a suitable spatial case-control study, we took spatial stratified heterogeneity impact expressed as Chinese seven geographical divisions into consideration. Third, for generating different types of disease relative risk maps, we proposed local-scale formulas for calculating three spatial epidemiologic indicators, i.e., spatial odds ratio, spatial risk ratio, and spatial attributable risk.

The results showed six congestion patterns for intra-regional roads and inter-regional roads on weekdays. On both intraregional and inter-regional roads, congestion density reflected by building height was the strongest indicator during the morning peak period. Public facilities such as hospitals, tourist sites and green spaces located near areas of employment or residential areas contributed to congestion during and off-peak hours. On intra-regional roads, the sparse road network and greater distance from the city center contribute to congestion during peak hours. On inter-regional roads, the number of bus stops contributed most to the early evening peak congestion, while the design of the entrances to large buildings in mixed business areas and public service areas increased the level of congestion. The results suggest that land use should be more mixed in high-density areas as this would reduce the number of trips made to the city center. However, mixed land-use planning should also be combined with a detailed design of the microenvironment to improve accessibility for different travel modes in order to increase the efficiency of traffic and reduce congestion.

First, we conclude that high spatial agglomeration, CO2 emissions centralized along the river and coastline, and a structure with three circular layers are the three notable temporal-spatial characteristics of Shanghai fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Second, we find that large point sources are the leading factors that shaped the temporal-spatial characteristics of Shanghai CO2 emission distributions. The changes of CO2 emissions in each grid during 2010-2015 indicate that the energy-controlling policies of large point emission sources have had positive effects on CO2 reduction since 2012. The changes suggest that targeted policies can have a disproportionate impact on urban emissions. Third, area sources bring more uncertainties to the forecasting of carbon emissions. We use the Geographical Detector method to identify these leading factors that influence CO2 emissions emitted from area sources. We find that Shanghai's circular layer structure, population density, and population activity intensity are the leading factors. This result implied that urban planning has a large impact on the distribution of urban CO2 emissions. At last, we find that unbalanced development within the city will lead to different leading impact factors for each circular layer. Factors such as urban development intensity, traffic land, and industrial land have stronger power to determine CO2 emissions in the areas outside the Outer Ring, while factors such as population density and population activity intensity have stronger impacts in the other two inner areas.

The cattle hoofprints are known to be some of the productive breeding sites for Anopheles (An.) arabiensis and An. fenestus in Southern and East African countries. Therefore, this study aimed at testing the potential of integrating field data and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for mapping cattle hoofprint distribution in the Vhembe District, South Africa. The purpose was to improve the predictability of mosquito breeding sites in the study area by using field point dataset and Sentinel-2 data. Due to the difficulty of sampling all locations in the study area, the spatial interpolation was employed to create continuous surfaces of cattle hoofprints, using limited sampled point observations. The sampled point observations were then correlated with Sentinel-derived variables for predicting cattle hoofprints at unsampled locations. The ordinary Kriging (OK), co-Kriging (CK) and step-wise multiple linear regression (SMLR) were used due to their ability to incorporate both field point data and ancillary datasets. The CK was the best performing interpolation method, with R-2 = 0.69 for validation dataset (n = 33), compared to OK (R-2 = 0.57) and SMLR (R-2 = 0.25). The resulting co-Kriging semivariogram shows that the combination of field data and remote sensing dataset improves the prediction accuracy of cattle hoofprint distribution. Findings from this study demonstrated that the interpolation error for estimating cattle hoofprints/100 m(2) can be minimized greatly by using CK (RMSE = 0.2; MAD = 0.04) than with both OK (RMSE = 2.39; MAD = 2.11) and SMLR (RMSE = 5.20; MAD = 4.55) methods. Furthermore, the results from this study indicate that there is a high number of cattle hoofprints in malaria-prone areas at the study site than in the malaria-free areas.

The sources and possible factors controlling the distribution of trace elements in the mosses were identified through multivariate statistical analysis and Pb isotopic ratios. The results showed that the concentrations of trace elements in the mosses were higher than the levels in most European countries but comparable to those in Chinese cities. Mosses had the highest concentration levels of Cd and Sb and slightly lower levels of other trace elements.

Healthy and active longevity could ease the ageing burden on families and communities. To date, most studies of the oldest-old distribution are focused on a simple scale from spatial perspective, and the multi-scale spatio-temporal clusters trend in the oldest-old population has not yet been determined. Thus, the objective in present study is to use a new method to evaluate the spatio-temporal pattern and detect the risk clusters in the oldest-old population from three scales.MethodsIndividuals aged 65 years or older and individuals aged 80 years or older on three scales in China from 2000 to 2010 were used. The exploratory spatial data analysis was performed using Moran's I statistic, and the pattern of the oldest-old clusters among humans was examined by using the spatial scan statistical method. Then, spatial stratified heterogeneity was used to explore the factors affecting the spatial heterogeneity of the oldest-old population.ResultsThe oldest-old index in the southeast coastal areas is higher than that in the northwest inland areas in China. A three-ladder terrain distribution of the oldest-old index from west to east is obvious. The overall pattern of the oldest-old index evolves from a \"concave\" shape to an \"east-west uplift, and northern collapse\" shape. Space-time analysis revealed that high-risk areas were concentrated in five regions: the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, the Southeast Coast, Sichuan and Chongqing, and the Central Plains. The oldest-old cluster at different scales shows a similar pattern, but local differences exist. The risk at the prefecture scale and county scale is greater than at the interprovincial scale; the sublevel can identify clusters that have not been identified at the previous level, especially the bordering areas of prefectures and counties; and more risk units and greater relative risk are found in urban areas than in rural areas.ConclusionsThe results emphasized that spatial scan statistics can be used to estimate the spatial clusters of the oldest-old people. The detection of these clusters might be highly useful in the surveillance of the ageing phenomenon, thus helping local public health authorities measure the population burden at all locations, identifying geographical areas that require more attention, and evaluating the impacts of intervention programs.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "HEALTH;LONGEVITY;CENTENARIANS;ENVIRONMENTS;INDICATORS;DISEASE", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Nanjing Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Virtual Geog Environm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China\n[ 4 ]‎ Nanjing Normal Univ, Ginling Coll, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China\n[ 5 ]‎ Nanjing Normal Univ, Int Ctr Aging & Hlth Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Science & Technology - Other Topics", "wos_categories": "Multidisciplinary Sciences"}

This study focuses on the effects of the seasonality of increasing social contacts on the incidence proportions at multiple district level of the childhood hand-foot-mouth disease in Da Nang city, Viet Nam from 2012 to 2016.Methods: We decomposed the nonstationary time series of the incidence proportions for the nine spatial-temporal (S-T) strata in the study area, where S indicates the spatial and T the temporal stratum. The long-term trends and the seasonality are presented by the Fourier series. To study the effects of the monthly average ambient temperature and the period of preschooling, we developed a spatial-temporal autoregressive model.Results: Seasonality of childhood hand-foot-mouth disease incidence proportions shows two peaks in all spatial strata annually: large peaks synchronously in April and small ones asynchronously during the preschooling period. The peaks of the average temperature are asynchronous with the seasonal peaks of the childhood hand-footmouth disease incidence proportions in the period between January and May, with the negative values of the regression coefficients for all spatial strata, respectively: beta(S1)(T11) = -0.18 +/- 0.07; beta(S2)(T11) = -0.25 +/- 0: 09; beta(S3)(T11) = -0.14 +/- 0.05. The increasingly cumulative preschooling period and the seasonal component of the incidence proportions are negatively correlated in the period between August and December, with the negative values of the regression coefficients for all temporal strata, respectively: beta(S1)(T32) = -0.40 +/- 0.01; beta(S2)(T32) = -0.29 +/- 0.00; beta(S3)(T32) = -0: 25 +/- 0.01.Conclusions: The study shows that social contact amongst children under five years of age is the important driving factor of the dynamics of the childhood hand-foot-mouth disease outbreaks in the study area. The preschooling season when children's contact with each other increases stimulates the geographical variation of the seasonality of childhood hand-foot-mouth disease infections at small areas in the study area.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Health seasonality;NTDs;Childhood HFMD;STAR;Fourier analysis;Disease;dynamics;health geography;small area analysis;SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATION;MOUTH-DISEASE;EPIDEMIOLOGY;DYNAMICS;MODELS;HAND", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Univ Twente, Fac Geoinformat Sci & Earth Observat, Enschede, Netherlands\n[ 2 ]‎ Pasteur Inst, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health", "wos_categories": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"}

Although various studies on ecosystem health have been carried out in different regions, few studies have been devoted to the insightful exploration of the spatial heterogeneity of ecosystem health and its driving forces at a national scale. In this study, we used an evaluation framework in terms of vigor, organization, resilience, and ecosystem service functions to assess the ecosystem health level in China from 2000 to 2015. Then, spatial agglomeration and regional differences in ecosystem health were examined using the spatial aulocorrelation method and K-means clustering analysis, and the factors driving the regional differences of ecosystem health were explored based on the geographical detector model Our results showed the following: (1) the ecosystem health level in China spatially increases from the northwest to the southeast, exhibiting significant global spatial autocorrelation and local spatial agglomeration; (2) eleven zones with three types were identified to indicate the regional differences of ecosystem health; (3) In terms of the driving factors, the moisture index and land use intensity contributed 24.5% and 20.7% to the variation in ecosystem health at the national scale. The ecosystem health changes were influenced by the interaction of meteorological and socio-economic factors in most regions with high ecosystem health types. Socio-economic factors act as a bridge that linked and reinforced the other factors in most regions with low and medium ecosystem health types.

This paper firstly presents a Bayesian space-time hierarch piecewise regression model (BSTHPRM) which can self-adaptively detect the transitions of local trends, accounting for spatial correlations. The spatiotemporal trends of the approximately anthropogenic PM2.5 removed natural dust (PM2.5_No Dust) concentrations and the corresponding population's PM2.5 No Dust exposure (PPM2.5E) in the global continent from 1998 to 2016 were investigated by the presented BSTHPRM. The total areas of the high and higher PM(2.5_No Dust )polluted regions, whose spatial relative magnitude of PM2.5_NoDust pollution to the global continental overall level was between 1.89 and 14.68, accounted for about 13.4% of the global land area, and the corresponding exposed populations accounted for 56.0% of the global total population. The spatial heterogeneity of the global PM2.5_NoDust pollution increased generally from 1998 to 2016. The areas of hot, warm, and cold spots with increasing trends of PM2.5_NoDust concentration initially contracted and then later expanded. The local trends of the global continental PM2.5_NoDust concentrations and PPM2.5E can be parted into three changing stages, early, medium, and later stages, using the BSTHPRM. The area proportions of the regions experiencing a decreasing trend of PM2.5_NoDust concentrations and PPM2.5E were greater in the medium stage than in the early and later stages. The local trends of PM2.5_NoDust concentration and PPM2.5E in the two higher PM2.5_NoDust polluted areas, northern India and eastern and southern China, increased in the early stage and then decreased in the medium stage.

In the first two stages, more than half of the areas in Europe experienced a decreasing trend of PM2.5_(NODust) concentration and PPM2.5E; later, more than half of areas in Europe exhibited increasing trends in the later stage.

Most published landslide susceptibility maps lack reliable information at the local scale due to the spatial heterogeneity being ignored. To enrich the local-scale information of LSM, multiple information fusion methods for the local spatial heterogeneity and regional trends of control factors are needed. However, no information fusion method has been proposed for LSM yet. In this paper, we developed a new integrated statistical method, named B-GeoSVC, under the hierarchical Bayesian framework for LSM. Specifically, this model applied the GeoDetector method to fit the regional trends of control factors and employed spatially varying coefficients (SVC) model to fit the local spatial heterogeneity of each control factor. Then, the regional trends and local spatial heterogeneity information were fused within the hierarchical Bayesian framework. The B-GeoSVC model was verified using data from the Duwen basin of China, which was in the central region affected by the M-S 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake that occurred on May 12, 2008. Under a cross-validation experiment, the prediction accuracy rate of the B-GeoSVC model was 86.09%, and the area under the curve was 0.93, which suggested that the B-GeoSVC model was able to achieve relatively accurate local-scale LSM and provide richer local information than traditional regional scale LSM.

Lower radiation, moderate temperature and rainfall may have favorable effects on the increase in the life expectancy. The life expectancy of Tibet is mainly affected by socioeconomy, geological and ecological environment; interactions between these factors can increase the impact on the life expectancy of Tibet.

For such a sampling design, the stratum proportions are usually unknown such that proportional allocation is infeasible and (X,Y)'s cannot be regarded as an i.i.d. sample between strata. We estimate the unknown cutoff determining higher/lower levels of X that optimally match the variable Y and provide the true positive rates (TPR) adjusted for the disproportionate stratum weights. Our approach is to estimate the underlying distribution of X, then conduct an ad-hoc estimation for the TPR and for the expected prediction errors under zero-one loss function. We develop parametric estimate of the distribution of X under exponential family assumption and a weighted-kernel density estimator when the distribution of X is unspecified.

Structural, spatiotemporal, and epidemiological information can be extracted from constructed trees to characterize the epidemic they represent and to correspond to environmental data. When multiple primary cases can be determined, the forest is ready to build. We applied this method to the 2013 dengue fever epidemic in Guangzhou City, China. With the constructed forest, we particularly calculated the case reproduction ratio (R-t), an index widely used for characterizing epidemics, at the global, tree-wise, and pixel-wise scales. We further calculated correlation coefficients between these R(t)s and climate variables. R(t)s at different scales, as well as their associations with climate variables, offer information at different levels that is all important in epidemiological studies and disease control practices. Through this study, we explored and demonstrated how to spatialize epidemic modeling, what information can be extracted from this spatialization, and then how to use the extracted information.

Many regression models based on land use types and urban fabrics have been built to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution of air pollutants, however, few of them examined the relationship between urban morphological characteristics and the distribution of air pollutants in a megacity. This study investigates such relationships for six types of air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O-3, and CO) and a composite AQI (Air Quality Index) based on hourly data at 35 monitoring stations in Beijing in 2016, with morphological characteristics (Morphological building index), meteorological factors (Land Surface Temperature, LST), land use (vegetation, road length, gas station and industry point data), and population distribution data. We also analyzed the results with spatiotemporal regression and SSH (Spatial Stratified Heterogeneity) models respectively. According to the spatiotemporal regression model, the morphological building index (MBI) shows a strong correlation with the dispersion of PM2.5 (R-2 = 0.81) and AQI (R-2 = 0.80) in the warm season and this finding was reinforced through the Leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) analysis. From the SSH analysis, the road length in a large proximal region impacts air pollutants the most, especially for O-3; and population density significantly affects PM 2.5, AQI, SO2, and NO2 in the cold season.

Guangdong Province is one of the most severely affected provinces in south China. This study aims to identify the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics and potential predictors of HFMD in Guangdong Province and provide a theoretical basis for the disease control and prevention. Methods: Case-based HFMD surveillance data from 2009 to 2012 was obtained from the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). The Bayesian spatiotemporal model was used to evaluate the spatiotemporal variations of HFMD and identify the potential association with meteorological and socioeconomic factors. Results: Spatially, areas with higher relative risk (RR) of HFMD tended to be clustered around the Pearl River Delta region (the mid-east of the province). Temporally, we observed that the risk of HFMD peaked from April to July and October to December each year and detected an upward trend between 2009 and 2012. There was positive nonlinear enhancement between spatial and temporal effects, and the distribution of relative risk in space was not fixed, which had an irregular fluctuating trend in each month. The risk of HFMD was significantly associated with monthly average relative humidity (RR: 1.015, 95% CI: 1.006-1.024), monthly average temperature (RR: 1.045, 95% CI: 1.021-1.069), and monthly average rainfall (RR: 1.004, 95% CI: 1.001-1.008), but not significantly associated with average GDP. Conclusions: The risk of HFMD in Guangdong showed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. There was spatiotemporal interaction in the relative risk of HFMD. Adding a spatiotemporal interaction term could well explain the change of spatial effect with time, thus increasing the goodness of fit of the model. Meteorological factors, such as monthly average relative humidity, monthly average temperature, and monthly average rainfall, might be the driving factors of HFMD.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "hand;foot;and mouth disease;Bayesian spatiotemporal models;spatiotemporal analysis;spatiotemporal interaction;potential predictors;METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS;SICHUAN PROVINCE;RISK;ASSOCIATION;VARIABLES;CHILDREN;CLIMATE;MODEL", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Med Stat & Epidemiol, 74 Zhong Shan 2nd Rd, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sun Yat Sen Global Hlth Inst, 135 Xin Gang Xi Rd, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Minist Educ, Key Lab Trop Dis & Control, Guangzhou 510080, Guangdong, Peoples R China\n[ 4 ]‎ SUNY Albany, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Rensselaer, NY 12144 USA", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health", "wos_categories": "Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"}

Highway alignment is an essential part of the highway planning and design phase, which has significant effects on the surroundings. Identifying optimal highway routes while using traditional methods requires significant time, cost, and effort, since it requires a comprehensive assessment of multiple factors, such as cost and environmental impacts. This study proposes an approach for managing highway alignment in the context of a larger landscape that integrates building information modelling (BIM) and geographic information system (GIS) capabilities. To support this integration, semantic web technologies are used to integrate data on a semantic level. Moreover, the approach also uses genetic algorithms (GAs) for optimizing highway alignments. A fully automated model is developed that enables data interoperability between BIM and GIS systems and also allows for data exchange between the integration model and the optimization algorithm. The model enables the full exploitation of features of the project and its surroundings for highway alignment planning. The proposed model is also applied to a real highway project to validate its effectiveness. The visualization model of the highway project and its surroundings provides a realistic three-dimensional image that produces a comprehensive virtual environment, where the project could be effectively planned and designed. That can help to reduce design errors and miscommunication, which, in turn, reduces project risks.

Such representation greatly simplifies the estimation of the probability density function from limited observations and allows us to derive a new probabilistic pixel-wise similarity measure based on the continuous domain Bhattacharyya coefficient.

In this study, the metal enrichment factor (EF) was used to measure the watershed distribution of Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd in sediments in the Wen-Rui Tang urban river system in Wenzhou, Eastern China. The Geographical Detector Method (GDM) was specifically evaluated for its ability to analyze spatial relationships between metal EFs and their anthropogenic and natural control factors, including densities of industry (DI), livestock (DL), service industries (DS), population (DP), and roads (DR), along with agricultural area (AG), sediment total organic carbon (TOC), and soil types (ST). Results showed that the watershed was highly contaminated by all metals with an EF trend of Cd >> Zn>Cu>Pb. The spatial distribution of EFs demonstrated high contamination of all metals in the southwestern region of the watershed where industrial activities were concentrated, and higher Cu and Zn concentrations in the northeastern region having a high density of livestock production. GDM results identified DI as the dominant determinant for all metals, while TOC and ST were determined to have a moderate secondary influence for Zn, Pb and Cd. Additionally, GDM revealed several additive and nonlinear interactions between anthropogenic and natural factors influencing metal concentrations. Compared to other correlation, multiple linear regression and geographically weighted regression, GDM demonstrated distinct advantages of being able to assess both categorical and continuous variables and determine both single and multiple factor interactions.

With a comprehensive consideration of 13 possible related factors, namely, the tectonic division, stratum, moisture index, gross domestic product, mean annual precipitation, soil type, groundwater type, elevation, mean annual temperature, vegetation type, geomorphic type, slope degree and slope aspect, our results indicate that the main exposure factors for KB in Qamdo City are geological factors (tectonic division and stratum), wetting factors (moisture index and mean annual precipitation), and an economic factor (gross domestic product). In contrast, other factors have little effect on the prevalence of KB in Qamdo City. All 13 factors either nonlinearly or bivariately enhance each other, and the interactions between these factors can increase the prevalence of KB. Consequently, it can be inferred that KB in Qamdo City is caused primarily by a set of multiple and interrelated disease risk factors.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "FUNGAL CONTAMINATION;DRINKING-WATER;DISEASE;SELENIUM;HEALTH;IODINE;SOIL;DEFICIENCY;DEFECTS;FINLAND", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Science & Technology - Other Topics", "wos_categories": "Multidisciplinary Sciences"}

Quantile linear regression was used to subtly measure the common variation tendency and strength of the global ageing rate and ageing population. The Bayesian space-time hierarchy model (BSTHM) was employed to assess the detailed spatial temporal evolution of ageing rate and ageing population in global 195 countries and regions.ResultsAnnual growth of the ageing (65 and above) rate occurred on six continents: Europe (0.1532%), Oceania (0.0873%), Asia (0.0834%), South America (0.0723%), North America (0.0673%) and Africa (0.0069%). The coefficient of variation of the global ageing rate increased from 0.54 in 1960 to 0.69 in 2017. The global ageing rate and ageing population increased over this period, correlating positively with their quantiles.

However, except for such heavily polluted regions as the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, regional integration of air quality management in other parts of China has rarely been discussed, due to limited research on the spatio-temporal aggregation of PM2.5 concentrations. To fill this gap, we employed a repeated-bisection method, which supports high dimensional datasets and bootstrap clustering, for spatio-temporal clustering of city-level PM2.5 concentrations in China using time-series PM2.5 data and the test of geographical detector proved the reliability of the clustering. Since no weighted geographical information was employed during the clustering process, this research suggested that PM2.5 concentrations in China were of strong spatial self-aggregation effects, which proved the necessity for regional integration of air quality management. Based on the spatio-temporal clustering of PM2.5 concentrations, we further proposed six divisions of PM2.5 concentrations across China, within which PM2.5 concentrations display similar variation patterns and specific emission-reduction measures can be implemented accordingly. The division output of PM2.5 concentrations was highly consistent with the recent \"2017 air pollution prevention and management plan for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and its surrounding areas\" plan, indicating the reliability and practical significance of the national division of PM2.5 concentrations based on spatio-temporal clustering.

Herein, we collected 127,797 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in mainland China from May 2009 to April 2010. Arrival days and peak days were calculated for all 340 prefectures to characterize the dissemination patterns of the pandemic. We first evaluated the effects of airports and railway stations on arrival days and peak days, and then we applied quantile regressions to quantify the relationships between arrival days and air, rail, and road travel. Our results showed that early arrival of the virus was not associated with an early incidence peak. Airports and railway stations in prefectures significantly advanced arrival days but had no significant impact on peak days. The pandemic spread across mainland China from the southeast to the northwest in two phases that were split at approximately 1 August 2009.

Methods The exploratory spatial data analysis method was used to analyze the spatial differentiation of nursing talents in mainland China, and the influencing factors were discussed by using the Geodetector model. Results The spatial pattern of nursing talents in mainland China changed from a very significant positive spatial autocorrelation to a non-significant negative spatial autocorrelation. Getis-Ord Gi* statistics showed a trend of high in the North and low in the South, high in the East and low in the West. Among the influencing factors, the level of economic development was the most important one, but its influence was weakened. The influence of health investment was gradually weakened, and the influence of aging degree decreased first and then rised. The interaction between influencing factors was gradually changed from two-factor enhancement to non-linear enhancement. Conclusion The differentiation of nursing talents in mainland China changed from agglomeration to irregular distribution with obvious regional characteristics, which was largely influenced by the level of economic development.

Bike sharing plays an important role in improving the accessibility of public transportation and reducing the motorized pollution. At the same time, it also brings out urban issues, such as excessive amount of bike sharing,and mismatch between supply and demand of bike sharing. The main reason for these problems is the lack of accurate prediction and effective scheduling for bike sharing ride. Exploring the spatial and temporal characteristics of bike sharing ride and detecting the influencing factors can provide scientific decision-making basis for precise prediction and effective scheduling of bike sharing. Even though some studies have paid attention to the influencing factors of bikesharing ride behaviors, most of them focused on the starting point but neglected the destination. Moreover, the temporal difference of influencing factors and the interaction between the factors were seldom revealed in the previous studies. Taking mobike in Guangzhou city as an example,this study aims to analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of the ride destination of bike sharing. We detect the temporal differences of the influencing factors of bike sharing ride destination,and further explores the interaction between the determinants by using geographical detector. The results show that: (1) The usage of bike sharing in morning-peak time is greater than that in evening-peak time, and the spatial distribution of bike sharing ride destination has obvious temporal differences. The ride destinations of bike sharing at morning peak period are mainly distributed at CBD, zone of information industry and job-housing balance areas. While the ride destinations at evening peak period are mainly distributed along Metro Line3 from Tiyuxi station to Huashi station as well as high-density residential areas. (2) The element of service facilities has the greatest impacts on the ride destinations of bike sharing, followed by the accessibility,land use and natural environment elements. To be more specifically, the influencing degree of the factors ranks as follows: residential communities distribution, catering facilities distribution,corporate distribution, shopping facilities distribution, road density, distance to metro station entrances and POI diversity. (3) The influence of each factor has remarkable temporal differences, for example, the influence of corporate distribution factor grows rapidly during the morning peak period. (4) The interaction effect of any two factors on the ride destinations of bike sharing is greater than the effect of one single factor.

Although chemical larvicide can also be used to eradicate the malaria vector at the larval stage, preventing the growth of mosquitoes into hematophagous adults, the continuous use of chemical insecticides leads to environmental pollution. It is therefore of paramount importance to identify effective, low-cost, biodegradable and environmentally friendly alternatives to chemical insecticides for the control of mosquito larvae.This mini-review aims to assess the present and future of the use of macrophytes as a mosquito larvicide.

Few studies have examined the spatial heterogeneity and the formation mechanism of China's eco-environmental quality at the national scale. This paper uses the eco- environmental quality index method to measure the eco-environmental effects of land use/land cover change (LULCC) to provide an overall review of eco-environmental quality index under complex physical and socioeconomic circumstances in China. We analyze the spatiotemporal evolution features and formation mechanism of eco- environmental quality from 1995 to 2015 with the gravity center analysis method, hot- spots analysis tool (Getis- Ord Gi*), and Geo- detectors tool. The results are as follows: (1) The eco-environmental quality of the eastern monsoon region is higher than that of the alpine region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the arid region of northwest China. The lowvalue regions of the eastern monsoon region are mainly distributed in urban areas with dense population and economic agglomeration. The gravity center of eco- environmental quality during the study period moves toward the northwest of China continuously; (2) The hot-spots areas of eco- environmental quality change during 1995-2015 are mainly distributed in Tibet, Xinjiang, Chongqing, Guizhou, and the provinces located in the Loess Plateau (Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan).

This paper builds the evaluation index system of the coupled development of human settlements system based on the five subsystems ofhuman-livingsupport- nature-society.

The research shows that: 1) From 2005 to 2016, the coupling degree and coupling coordination degree of the human settlements system in Liaoning Province showed a slow upward trend. There is a difference in the degree of coordination between cities. The high value areas of coupling coordination degree includes Shenyang and Dalian. The median area of coupling coordination degree includes Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Dandong, Jinzhou, Yingkou, Liaoyang, Panjin, Tieling, Chaoyang and Huludao.

It is of great significance to understand and optimize mulched drip irrigation in arid region by analyzing the characteristics of evapotranspiration in mulched drip-irrigated farmland and comparing it with ordinarily irrigated farmland. Using the oasis sunflower farmland in the Sangong River basin on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountain in Xinjiang as the study area, the farmland evapotranspiration characteristics during the sunflower growth period in 2016 were analyzed using the Bowen ratio- energy balance method, geographical detector, and path analysis method. Furthermore, these characteristics were compared to those of ordinarily irrigated farmlands. The results showed that: 1) for mulched drip-irrigated farmland, the average daily evapotranspiration was highest at the flowering stage, followed by the maturity stage, and lowest in the seedling stage. With the growth of crops, the correlation between net radiative flux and daily evapotranspiration gradually decreased. The change trends of average daily evapotranspiration were the same as those of ordinarily irrigated farmland, whereas the average daily evapotranspiration of mulched drip-irrigated farmland was lower than that of ordinarily irrigated farmland at each stage. 2) Regarding the intraday flux in mulched drip-irrigated farmland, the net radiative flux peak was highest at the flowering stage, followed by that at the mature stage, and the minimum appeared at the seedling stage. In terms of turbulent flux, the latent heat flux was equivalent to the sensible heat flux at the seedling stage. Post the flowering period, the latent heat flux was significantly higher than the sensible heat flux, and this characteristic was the opposite at the mature stage. For the ordinarily irrigated farmland, the latent heat flux was higher than the sensible heat flux in all three crop growth stages. 3) The relationship between evapotranspiration and meteorological factors calculated by path analysis showed that temperature, humidity, and wind speed were the dominant factors influencing evapotranspiration.

The impact of risk factors on DENV transmission was qualified by the q-values calculated using a novel spatial-temporal method, the GeoDetector model. Both climatic and socioeconomic factors were considered. The impacts on DF incidence of each single factor and the interaction of two factors were analysed.

In addition, an increased number of tourists in the city were associated with a high incidence of DF. This study demonstrates that the number of rain days in a month has great influence on the DF incidence of the month after next; the temperature and precipitation have nonlinear impacts on the DF incidence in Guangzhou; both the domestic and overseas tourists coming to the city increase the risk of DENV transmission.

In addition to the basic variables, the relative humidity models use air temperature and ozone concentration as covariates, and the wind speed models use wind speed coarse-resolution reanalysis data as covariates. In our spatiotemporal models, spatial coordinates capture the spatial variation and time index of the day captures the time variation. Compared with GAM, residual network significantly improved the prediction accuracy: on average, CV (Cross Validation) R2of the three meteorological factors increased by 0.21, CV RMSE decreased by 37%, and the relative humidity model improved the most (CV R2: 0.85 vs. 0.52, CV RMSE: 7.53% vs. 13.59%).

In addition, the selection of condition factors was not objective to such an extent that it may have reduced the reliability of LSM. To address these problems, a new method based on GeoDetector and a spatial logistic regression (SLR) model is proposed. GeoDetector is used to select condition factors based on the spatial distribution of landslides. The SLR model is used to make full use of the structural and attribute information of spatial objects simultaneously in LSM. The GeoDetector-SLR model is validated using data from the Duwen Highway Basin, which indudes the epicenter of the May 12, 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in southwestern China. Prediction accuracy of the GeoDetector-SLR model is found to be 86.1%, which is an 11.9% improvement over the traditional logistic regression model, indicating an improved and reliable solution for evaluating landslide susceptibility.

A high-precision Baidu migration process combined with mass relationships is applied in this study and enables the generation of regression coefficients of gravity model based on programmed large-scale regression simulations. A series of accuracy assessments are then developed for 2015 empirical projection daily regression coefficients that can be applied to Chinese spring interprovincial mobile gravity model variables as well as spatiotemporal research that utilizes regression coefficients within a heterogeneity research model. This approach also enables the error within the gravity model to be assessed in terms of floating population simulations. The results of this analysis lead to a number of clear conclusions, including the fact that parameter calibration complexity for the Chinese population mobility gravity model is reflected in the degree of influence asymmetry within spatial object interaction variables, and that the spatial heterogeneity of the variable regression coefficient increases in two distinct fashions. The first of these increases has to do with the overall influence of specific variables, including the fact that differences between proxies tend to be higher than inflowoutflow characteristics. In contrast, the second set of increases is related to economic levels, industrial scales, the proportion of the tertiary industry, and public service facilities. In this latter case, two-way population flow exerts a more profound influence on results and thus the scope of possible explanations for phenomena is more extensive. The regression coefficient for the existence of positive and negative proxy variables therefore relates to differences in spatial heterogeneity, including at the city level, and also assumes that floating population gravity model regression coefficients ignore spatiotemporal changes in the heterogeneity coefficient. This leads to spatial differences in estimated results and thus convergence trends, but further enables the identification of anisotropic interactions in extension space. The second main conclusion of this research is that the national scale population flow distance attenuation coefficient was 1.970 during the spring of 2015, while at the level of prefectural administrative units and given population outflow, the range encapsulated by this coefficient fell between 0.712 (Zhumadian) and 7.699 (Urumqi). Data also reveal a population inflow coefficient of 0.792 for this year that ranged as high as 8.223 in both Sanya and Urumqi. Population flow simulation results using the gravity model and including Baidu migration measured flow data were also subject to significant error. Third, the results of this analysis reveal a total fitting error of 85.54% in weighted absolute mean; the spatial interaction effect within this is responsible for a maximum error of 86.09% in actual and simulated flows, while relative outflow force and attractiveness encompass 57.73% and 49.34% of model error, respectively.

To improve the quality of a reconstructed image, this paper presents a MAP block super-resolution reconstruction algorithm based on the prior Huber Markov Random Field (HMRF) model. Firstly, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to obtain the main components for a given hyper-spectral image, and then the initial image is obtained by spline interpolation technique. By using main components from the PCA operation, the proposed algorithm can not only effectively reduce the usage of computation memory but also reserve most of the information from the image. After calculating the Q statistic of the initial image, it is found that stratifying the hyper-spectral image into several (e.g., seven in this study) spatial heterogeneities is an effective way to characterize the complexity of the hyper-spectral image. To this end, a suitable partitioning scheme for obtaining an optimal super-resolution reconstructed image is adopted after comparing the reconstructed results by using different blocks with different sizes. As a result, the domain of the hyper-spectral image is split into several sub-blocks. The HMRF model with an adaptive threshold is then established for each sub-block image, and an objective function is defined by combining the fidelity terms of the sub-block images. The objective function can be solved by using the gradient descent method to obtain the high resolution sub-block images, which are then combined with the interpolated secondary component images. Though some cross artifacts occur in the process, they can be removed by extending edge based methods. The effective extending edge-based method is also proposed in this paper. Finally, the final high resolution image can be obtained by using the inverse PCA operation. In order to verify the validity and the superiority of the proposed algorithm, we test the proposed algorithm, the representative Tikhonov-based algorithm, total variation-based algorithm, and the traditional HMRF model-based super-resolution reconstruction method with the simulated and real images, respectively. The testing results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to other methods in the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the Structure Similarity Image Measure (SSIM).The qualitative evaluation indicated that the proposed method could obtain more obvious edge structure and detailed information at the same time.", "abstract_ch": "针对高光谱图像应用最大后验概率(Maximum A Posteriori, MAP)超分重建后细节信息丢失严重问题,本文提出一种基于先验Huber马尔科夫随机场(Huber Markov Random Field, HMRF)模型的MAP分块超分辨率重建算法,以期提高图像超分重建质量。首先,利用主成分变换获取图像域的主要成分,在此基础上采用样条插值得到初始迭代图像;而后将初始图像域分为若干子块,在每个子块图像域上建立具有自适应阈值的HMRF模型,并结合子块图像域的保真项构建目标函数,采用梯度最快下降法求解此函数得到超分子块图像,将其重组,进而与插值后的次要成分图像相结合,最后应用主成分逆变换方法得到最终的高分辨率图像。为了验证本文算法的有效性与优越性,分别对模拟和真实图像采用本文方法和具有代表性的Tikhonov、总变分及传统HMRF模型超分重建方法进行实验对比,其中本文方法重建结果在峰值信噪比和结构相似性定量评价方面明显优于其他方法重建结果,在定性评价方面边缘结构及细节信息也更加明显,表明本文算法较为突出。", "keywords_en": "image segmentation; adaptive threshold; hyperspectral image; HMRF model; principal component transformation", "keywords_ch": "图像域分块; 自适应阈值; 高光谱图像; HMRF模型; 主成分变换", "address_en": "Wang Huabin,Liaoning Technical University, Institute of Remote Sensing Science and Application;;National Bureau of Surveying and Mapping Geographic Information, Satellite Surveying Application Center, ;;, Fuxin;;, ;;Beijing 123000;;100048.Tao Wancheng,Liaoning Technical University, Institute of Remote Sensing Science and Application, Fuxin, Liaoning 123000, China.Li Yu,Liaoning Technical University, Institute of Remote Sensing Science and Application, Fuxin, Liaoning 123000, China.Zhao Quanhua,Liaoning Technical University, Institute of Remote Sensing Science and Application, Fuxin, Liaoning 123000, China.", "address_ch": "王华斌,辽宁工程技术大学遥感科学与应用研究所;;国家测绘地理信息局卫星测绘应用中心, ;;, 阜新;;, ;;北京 123000;;100048.陶万成,辽宁工程技术大学遥感科学与应用研究所, 阜新, 辽宁 123000, 中国.李玉,辽宁工程技术大学遥感科学与应用研究所, 阜新, 辽宁 123000, 中国.赵泉华,辽宁工程技术大学遥感科学与应用研究所, 阜新, 辽宁 123000, 中国.", "research_areas": "Remote Sensing", "wos_categories": ""}

Accordingly, the comprehensive characterization of the eutrophication status in terms of improved quantitative methods is valuable for local risk assessment and policy making. A novelty of this work is that the spatial distributions of chemical oxygen demand, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and dissolved inorganic phosphorus were estimated across space by the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) method. The BME estimates were found to have the best cross-validation performance compared to ordinary kriging and inverse distance weighted techniques. Based on the BME maps, it was found that about 25.95%, 19.18%, 20.53%, and 34.34% of these coastal waters were oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic, and hypereutrophic. Another novelty of the present work is that comprehensive stochastic site indicators (SSI) were introduced in the quantitative characterization of the eutrophication risk in the Zhejiang coastal waters under conditions of in situ uncertainty. The results showed that the level of the eutrophication index (EI) increased almost linearly with increasing threshold values; and that 71%, 51%, and 19% of coastal locations separated by various spatial lags experience considerable mesotrophic, eutrophic, and hypereutrophic risks, respectively. The average EI values over the subregions of the Zhejiang coastal waters graded as \"oligotrophic or higher,\" \"eutrophic or higher,\" and \"hypereutrophic\" were about 11.14, 14.28, and 25.34, respectively. Our results also revealed that the joint eutrophication strength between coastal locations in the Zhejiang region was consistently greater than the combined strength of independent eutrophications at these locations (we termed this situation \"positive quadrant eutrophication dependency\"). It was found that a critical eutrophication threshold zeta(cr) approximate to 8.38 exists so that below zeta(cr) the spatial eutrophication dependency in the Zhejiang coastal waters increases with zeta, whereas above zeta(cr) the opposite is true. Moreover, the eutrophication dependency decreases as the separation distance delta s increases. Interestingly, at distances delta s smaller than a critical distance delta s(cr) approximate to 15 km, the eutrophication locations are concentrated in the coastal waters of the Zhejiang province rather than being dispersed (this observation holds even for large thresholds zeta). Elasticity analysis of eutrophication indicators offered a quantitative measure of the excess eutrophication change in the Zhejiang coastal waters caused by a threshold change (the larger the elasticity is, the more sensitive eutrophication is to threshold changes). The above findings can contribute to an improved understanding of seawater quality and provide a practical approach for the identification of critical coastal water regions.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "YANGTZE-RIVER ESTUARY;RISK-ASSESSMENT;POLLUTION;NITROGEN;SYSTEMS;REGION;GULF;TIME", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Inst Isl & Coastal Ecosyst, Zhoushan, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, Guangzhou Inst Geochem, State Key Lab Organ Geochem, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China\n[ 4 ]‎ San Diego State Univ, Dept Geog, San Diego, CA 92182 USA", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography", "wos_categories": "Limnology; Oceanography"}

Then, the power of determinant (q) was calculated using geodetector to measure the affinity between the environmental factors and arsenic (As) and lead (Pb). Geology was the dominant factor for As distribution in the this study area; it explained 38% of the spatial variation in As, and nonlinear enhancements were observed for the interactions between geology and elevation (q = 0.50) and slope (q = 0.49). Land-use and vegetation bi-enhanced each other and explained 39% of the spatial variation in Pb. These results indicated that geology and relief were the factors controlling the spatial distribution of As, and organism factors, especially anthropogenic activities, were the factors controlling the spatial distribution of Pb in the study area. As was derived from weathering transportation, and deposition processes of original bedrock and subsequent pedogenesis, and anthropogenic activity was the most likely source of Pb contamination in urban topsoil in Shenzhen.

Based on the quantification of ecosystem services, we assessed the spatial patterns and changes, and identified the relationships between the type diversity of ecosystem services and land-use change. We also analyzed the effect of the spatial differentiation of influencing factors on ecosystem services, using the geographical detector model. The results showed that the average value of crop production increased substantially between 2000 and 2010, whereas the net primary productivity decreased significantly, and the water retention and soil conservation decreased slightly. The ecosystem services exhibited a spatial similar to that of influencing factors, and the combination of any two factors strengthened the spatial effect more than a single factor. The geomorphic factors (elevation and slope) were found to control the distribution of NPP, water retention, and soil conservation. The population density was responsible for crop production. We also found that the urbanization rate plays a major indirect role in crop production and water retention when interacting with population density and slope, respectively. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) indirectly influences the spatial distribution of NPP when interacting with geomorphic factors. These findings highlight the need to promote new strategies of land-use management in the BTH.

Codispersion analysis is a new statistical method developed to assess spatial covariation between two spatial processes that may not be isotropic or stationary. Its application to data from large forest plots has provided new insights into mechanisms underlying observed patterns of species distributions and the relationship between individual species and underlying edaphic and topographic gradients.

Different from the traditional point or area based geospatial attributes, the performance of pavement infrastructure is the line segment based spatial data. Thus, a segment-based spatial stratified heterogeneity method is utilized to explore the comprehensive impacts of vehicles, climate, properties of road and socioeconomic conditions on pavement infrastructure performance. Segment-based optimal discretization is applied on discretizing segment-based pavement data, and a segment-based geographical detector is utilized to assess the spatial impacts of variables and their interactions. Results show that the segment-based methods can more reasonably and accurately describe the characteristics of line segment based spatial data and assess the spatial associations.

All these factors are mutually enhancing in changing carbon emissions, while oil share with energy intensity and coal share were more significantly enhanced in China's carbon emission than other interactions.

The results indicate that air pollution levels in 2015 in China are still high on the whole, with PM2.5, PM10, and O-3 as the major primary pollutants. Temporally, air pollution in China presents a U-shape pattern over the year, while the primary pollutants vary across seasons. Spatially, air pollution in China is characterized by spatial clustering and witnesses higher levels in Northern China and Xinjiang Province and lower levels in Southern China, but the location of some air pollution hot spots change by seasons. Spatial patterns of the primary pollutants are divided into five types of region according to their occurrence frequency. On average, natural factors are found to exert more effects on air pollution in China than socioeconomic factors. Additionally, interactions among the driving factors have either nonlinear-enhanced or bi-enhanced effects on air pollution.

Although significant variations of single sensor readings may be easily detected, discovering correlations between multiple sensor readings is challenging without using advanced data analytics tools. To tackle this issue, we present an itemset-based data mining approach to analyzing WSN data. It identifies the combinations of sensors (of arbitrary size) whose readings are unexpectedly low in a given time period. Since the readings acquired by multiple sensors may decrease in an alternate fashion, the discovered patterns provide new information compared to single sensor analysis. To make the mined patterns manageable by domain experts for manual inspection, the mining algorithm is driven by spatial constraints defined on the WSN topology.The experimental results, achieved on real WSN data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting heating system malfunctioning.

Thus, understanding residents' satisfaction with urban livability in China and its determinants is beneficial for urban planning and policy making regarding livable cities construction.

Drawing on large-scale questionnaire surveys conducted in 2015 in 40 major cities in China, this paper aims to explore the characteristics of satisfaction with urban livability and the effect magnitude of its determinants using the geographical detector model. The results show that the respondents are just moderately satisfied with urban livability in China (2.996). With respect to the dimensions of urban livability, the respondents are relatively satisfied with the convenience of public facilities (3.118), the natural environment (3.057) and the sociocultural environment (3.056), while slightly dissatisfied with urban security (2.788), environmental health (2.912) and convenient transportation (2.929). The result of the geographical detector model further reveals that all the six dimensions of urban livability have significant and positive impacts upon overall satisfaction with urban livability, of which the natural environment, convenient transportation, environmental health are the greatest contributing factors. Moreover, individual socioeconomic attributes such as geographical location, type of housing, education, family size, age, hukou status, also exert significant effects on overall satisfaction with urban livability in descending order, but the magnitude of their effects is far less than that of the dimensions of urban livability.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Urban livability;Satisfaction;Determinants;Geographical detector;China;RESIDENTIAL SATISFACTION;LIFE-SATISFACTION;MIGRANT WORKERS;OGUN STATE;NEIGHBORHOOD;QUALITY;CONTEXT;HEALTH;LIVEABILITY;CITIES", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Reg Sustainable Dev Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Urbana, IL 61820 USA\n[ 4 ]‎ Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Spatial Planning, Utrecht, Netherlands\n[ 5 ]‎ Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China\n[ 6 ]‎ Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Land & Urban Rural Dev Inst, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Urban Studies", "wos_categories": "Urban Studies"}

The HFRS was initially detected in northeast China in 1931, and since 1955 it has been detected in many regions of the country. Global climate dynamics influences HFRS spread in a complex nonlinear way. The quantitative assessment of the spatiotemporal variation of the \"HFRS infections-global climate dynamics\" association at a large geographical scale and during a long time period is still lacking.Methods and findingsThis work is the first study of a recently completed dataset of monthly HFRS cases in Eastern China during the period 2005-2016. A methodological synthesis that involves a time-frequency technique, a composite space-time model, hotspot analysis, and machine learning is implemented in the study of (a) the association between HFRS incidence spread and climate dynamics and (b) the geographic factors impacting this association over Eastern China during the period 2005-2016. The results showed that by assimilating core and city-specific knowledge bases the synthesis was able to depict quantitatively the space-time variation of periodic climate-HFRS associations at a large geographic scale and to assess numerically the strength of this association in the area and period of interest. It was found that the HFRS infections in Eastern China has a strong association with global climate dynamics, in particular, the 12, 18 and 36 mos periods were detected as the three main synchronous periods of climate dynamics and HFRS distribution. For the 36 mos period (which is the period with the strongest association), the space-time correlation pattern of the association strength indicated strong temporal but rather weak spatial dependencies. The generated space-time maps of association strength and association hotspots provided a clear picture of the geographic variation of the association strength that often-exhibited cluster characteristics (e.g., the south part of the study area displays a strong climate-HFRS association with non-point effects, whereas the middle-north part displays a weak climate-HFRS association). Another finding of this work is the upward climate-HFRS coherency trend for the past few years (2013-2015) indicating that the climate impacts on HFRS were becoming increasingly sensitive with time. Lastly, another finding of this work is that geographic factors affect the climate-HFRS association in an interrelated manner through local climate or by means of HFRS infections. In particular, location (latitude, distance to coastline and longitude), grassland and woodland are the geographic factors exerting the most noticeable effects on the climate-HFRS association (e.g., low latitude has a strong effect, whereas distance to coastline has a wave-like effect).ConclusionsThe proposed synthetic quantitative approach revealed important aspects of the spatio-temporal variation of the climate-HFRS association in Eastern China during a long time period, and identified the geographic factors having a major impact on this association. Both findings could improve public health policy in an HFRS-torn country like China. Furthermore, the synthetic approach developed in this work can be used to map the space-time variation of different climate-disease associations in other parts of China and the World.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "NINO-SOUTHERN-OSCILLATION;RENAL SYNDROME EPIDEMIC;4 CORNERS REGION;HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER;HANTAAN VIRUS;UNITED-STATES;TIME-SERIES;EL-NINO;SEASONAL PRECIPITATION;LONG-TERM", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Zhoushan, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ San Diego State Univ, Dept Geog, San Diego, CA 92182 USA\n[ 3 ]‎ Ecole Normale Super, Inst Biol, UMR 8197, Ecoevolutionary Math, Paris, France\n[ 4 ]‎ UPMC, UMI IRD 209, Int Ctr Math & Computat Modeling Complex Syst UMM, Bondy, France\n[ 5 ]‎ Inst Dis Control & Prevent PLA, Ctr Dis Surveillance PLA, Beijing, Peoples R China\n[ 6 ]‎ Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Div Infect Dis, Key Lab Surveillance & Early Warning Infect Dis, Beijing, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine", "wos_categories": "Infectious Diseases; Parasitology; Tropical Medicine"}

This paper is the first to introduce a new remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI) to assess the urban ecological quality. The RSEI integrated the primary land surface components (i.e., the build-up area and vegetation cover) and the climate (the land surface temperature and land surface moisture) based on the framework of the pressure-state-response (PSR) using a principal components analysis (PCA). In taking advantage of the same data source for all the indicators, the RSEI was shown to be scalable, visualizable and comparable at different spatio-temporal scales, and it can avoid the variation or error in weight definitions caused by individual characteristics. We used Fuzhou City in Fujian Province, south-eastern China, as a case study, it showed that Fuzhou demonstrated ecological deterioration during the study period from 2000 to 2016, with its RSEI value decreasing from 0.595 in 2000 to 0.503 in 2016. Moreover, the results of the spatial autocorrelation and semi-variance indicated that there was a spatial correlation in the distribution of the RSEI, with high clusters at the edge and low clusters in the centre of the city. The values of the sill, the nugget: sill ratio and the range all increased from 2000 to 2016, which indicated a higher spatial autocorrelation and lower spatial heterogeneity percentage in 2016 than that in 2000 in terms of the RSEI. Based on the combination with the spatial clusters and the spatiotemporal clusters, we confirmed that the RSEI is not randomly distributed. Moreover, a hole-effect semivariogram was observed, indicating a high level of human intervention in the study area.

Six interpolation models (area- and-point kriging, AAPK; inverse distance weighting, IDW; local polynomial interpolation, LP; ordinary kriging, OK; simple kriging, SK; and thin plate spline, TPS), three sampling methods (random, stratified, and systematic sampling), and five sampling proportions (1, 5, 10, 15, and 20%) are considered in this study using sets of simulated data, and the real situation was tested for verification. The results show that, in general, with the increase of spatial autocorrelation or the sampling percentage, the accuracy and stability of different interpolation models gradually increase; however, the various interpolation models have their own specific characteristics and application conditions. The best application conditions of the interpolation models compared with other models under the same situation are summarized and explained in theory.

The Biased Sentinel Hospitals Areal Disease Estimation (BSHADE) method, used in this study, makes a best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) when a sample is small and biased to a spatially heterogeneous population.

Additionally, warming exhibited different spatial patterns in different periods. In the early 20th century (1923-1950), warming occurred mainly in the mid-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, whereas in the most recent decades (1977-2014), warming was more spatially extensive across the global land surface. Compared with other common methods, the difference in results appears in the areas with few stations and in the early years, when stations had sparse coverage and were unevenly distributed. Validation, which was performed using real data that simulated the historic situation, showed a smaller error in the BSHADE estimate than in other methods.

Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is a critical tool for preventing or mitigating the negative impacts of landslides. Although many previous studies have employed various statistical methods to produce quantitative maps of the landslide susceptibility index (LSI) based on inventories of past landslides and contributing factors, they are mostly ad hoc to a specific area and their success has been hindered by the lack of a methodology that could produce the right mapping units at proper scale and by the lack of a general framework for objectively accounting for the differing contribution of various preparatory factors. This paper addresses these issues by integrating the geomorphon and geographical detector methods into LSM to improve its performance. The geomorphon method, an innovative pattern recognition approach for identifying landform elements based on the line of sight concept, is adapted to delineate ridge lines and valley lines to form slope units at self-adjusted spatial scale suitable for LSM. The geographical detector method, a spatial variance analysis method, is integrated to objectively assign the weights of contributing factors for LSM. Applying the new integrated approach to I-Lan, Taiwan produced very significant improvement in LSI mapping performance than a previous model, especially in highly susceptible areas. The new method offers a general framework for better mapping landslide susceptibility and mitigating its negative impacts.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Landslide susceptibility mapping;Geomorphon;Geographical detector;Slope units;Frequency ratio;Weights;LOGISTIC-REGRESSION MODELS;REMOTE-SENSING DATA;LAND-USE CHANGE;STATISTICAL-MODELS;HAZARD ASSESSMENT;FREQUENCY RATIO;RISK-ASSESSMENT;AREA;CHINA;CLASSIFICATION", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Northern Illinois Univ, Dept Geog, De Kalb, IL 60115 USA\n[ 2 ]‎ Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Global Earth Observat & Data Anal Ctr, Dept Earth Sci, Tainan, Taiwan", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Engineering; Geology", "wos_categories": "Engineering, Geological; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary"}

Some methods such as metaheuristic algorithms, calculation parallelism, and reducing the time of objective function calculation could be used to increase the calculation speed; among these methods, the latter is preferred due to its extensive influence on the optimization of time. The main reasons that make the objective function calculation cumbersome are mentioned hereafter, and according to their priority: (1) excessive quantity of blocks in the geological block model, and (2) inverting the matrix of average semivariogram between samples is a time consuming operation. The present study aims to decrease the calculation time by reducing the number of blocks without considering their size increment that affects accuracy. To achieve this purpose, the objective function is calculated according to the block model of uncertainty zone, which is defined by using the recently introduced distance function to investigate uncertainty in mineralized domain boundaries. In order to evaluate the performance of the present approach on reducing the calculation time as well as the precision in locating additional boreholes, the results from particle swarm optimization as a metaheuristic algorithm are compared by considering two different scenarios of combined variance reduction on the basis of a three-dimensional geological block model and an uncertainty block model. The comparative results show that using the uncertainty block model reduces the calculation time by one-third, and the proposed locations of the boreholes are more consistent to the study's aim, which is to reduce the boundary's uncertainty.

In experiments, we applied this method to three Chinese citiesBeijing, Putian, and Zhuhaiand generated detailed functional-zone maps with diverse functional categories.

China is an agricultural country with a large but poor rural population. At the village level, poverty alleviation has the potential to affect millions of citizens. The Loess Plateau is a composite of fragile ecological environment and rural poverty communities. As a backward economy often twins with fragile ecology, studying poverty from a multidimensional perspective in tandem with spatial heterogeneity and its influencing factors can provide an effective analysis of poverty in regions with characteristics similar to those of the Loess Plateau. This study features Pengyang, which is a poverty-stricken county located on the Loess Plateau, and relies on the approach by Alkire and Foster to measure multidimensional poverty, using spatial autocorrelation, Geodetector, OLSR and quantile regression (QR) analysis. Results from our investigation show that the study area has a deep level of multidimensional poverty, with a Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) score of 0.045. The rates of health, housing, and education dimensions were 0.263, 0.245, and 0.227, respectively. Moran's I of MPI was 0.2, which indicates that multidimensional poverty was positively correlated with a spatial pattern of \"north, south, middle; high, high, low\". Using Geodetector, the mean distance between villages and the center of town, as well as the mean elevation of the villages and mean distance to a river, were found to be the main factors of spatial heterogeneity within the MPI. The q-values of them were 0.552, 0.396, and 0.326, respectively, and the result of regression analysis conforms to the Geodetector. The interaction of the above factors enabled the creation of a multidimensional poverty spatial heterogeneity mechanism at village level for the Loess Plateau, revealing a lack in welfare of farmers, the poor of infrastructure, the congenital deficiency and stalled development of industry, and weak government functioning at the township level. Our results suggest that new strategies regarding urbanization should be investigated in order to improve and ensure the quality of public services in areas with similar characteristic as the Loess Plateau. These new strategies could enable the resolution of problems from the root, such as designing public goods and services that fill gaps in current health care and housing options, as well as the operation of transport facilities at the village level. This could help to mitigate welfare loss of farmers as well as reduce the negative impact of health, housing, education, and other dimensions of poverty.", "abstract_ch": "黄土高原属于生态环境脆弱与农村经济贫困的复合区域,研究其村域多维贫困及空间异质性有助揭示乡村贫困原因及空间格局。以宁夏彭阳县为研究区,运用A-F法对村域多维贫困进行测度,并结合空间自相关、地理探测器和回归分析方法对其空间异质性进行了系统分析。结果表明:①研究区农户多维贫困程度较深,K= 3时,多维贫困指数(MPI)为0.045,平均剥夺份额0.361,主要致贫维度是住房、健康和教育,贡献率分别为0.263、0.245、0.227,收入维度贡献率仅占0.130;② MPI空间自相关Moran's I值为0.2,即存在正相关,呈现南北高,中部低的格局;③地理探测器结果显示行政村到镇中心的距离、村平均高程、村委会到主要河流的距离是影响MPI空间异质性的主要因子,其决定力q值分别为0.552、0.396、0.326,且在最小二乘线性回归(OLSR)和分位数回归(QR)中均通过了1%的显著性检验;④各因子间的相互作用形成了黄土高原农户福利缺失、基础设施落后与产业发展受阻、乡镇政府职能被削弱的村域多维贫困空间分异机制。⑤最后提出推进新型城镇化建设,实现公共服务均等化,从根源上解决农村医疗、住房、交通设施落后等难题的建议。", "keywords_en": "multidimensional poverty; spatial heterogeneity; Geodetector; quantile regression; Loess Plateau", "keywords_ch": "多维贫困; 空间异质性; 地理探测器; 分位数回归; 黄土高原", "address_en": "Wen Qi,School of Resources and Environment, Ningxia University;;Key Laboratory (China-Arab) of Resource Evaluation and Environmental Regulation of Arid Region in Ningxia, ;;Key Laboratory (China-Arab) of Resource Evaluation and Environmental Regulation of Arid Region in Ningxia, Yinchuan;;Yinchuan, ;; 750021;;750021.Shi Linna,School of Resources and Environment, Ningxia University;;Key Laboratory (China-Arab) of Resource Evaluation and Environmental Regulation of Arid Region in Ningxia, ;;Key Laboratory (China-Arab) of Resource Evaluation and Environmental Regulation of Arid Region in Ningxia, Yinchuan;;Yinchuan, ;; 750021;;750021.Ma Caihong,School of Resources and Environment, Ningxia University;;Key Laboratory (China-Arab) of Resource Evaluation and Environmental Regulation of Arid Region in Ningxia, ;;Key Laboratory (China-Arab) of Resource Evaluation and Environmental Regulation of Arid Region in Ningxia, Yinchuan;;Yinchuan, ;; 750021;;750021.Wang Yongsheng,Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.", "address_ch": "文琦,宁夏大学资源环境学院;;宁夏(中阿)旱区资源评价与环境调控重点实验室, ;;宁夏(中阿)旱区资源评价与环境调控重点实验室, 银川;;银川, ;; 750021;;750021.施琳娜,宁夏大学资源环境学院;;宁夏(中阿)旱区资源评价与环境调控重点实验室, ;;宁夏(中阿)旱区资源评价与环境调控重点实验室, 银川;;银川, ;; 750021;;750021.马彩虹,宁夏大学资源环境学院;;宁夏(中阿)旱区资源评价与环境调控重点实验室, ;;宁夏(中阿)旱区资源评价与环境调控重点实验室, 银川;;银川, ;; 750021;;750021.王永生,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 北京 100101, 中国.", "research_areas": "Agriculture", "wos_categories": ""}

To fill this understanding gap, the paper attempts to understand the economic growth and spatial aggregation effects of transport investment and the potential influential paths based on a joint estimation by the spatial panel and structural equation modeling, respectively. The results of the study indicate that: (1) The significant economic growth, as well as economic impacts of spatial aggregation of transport investment are observed, but in general the effects would decrease after controlling the spatial autocorrelation issue; (2) The economic effects of the investment in transport sectors have considerable spatial and temporal differences. For areas with high level of urbanization and economic performance, the economic effect of transport investment is much higher and more significant. To some extent, transport investment in these areas exerts a more significant impact of spatial aggregation. The temporal effects show that from 1997 to 2015 the transport investment can reinforce the economic performance and the level of spatial aggregation. Also, the transport investments at the previous stage, in general, have a greater effect on economic growth, and would lead to a spatial decentralization trend of economic activities; (3) Transport investment can promote economic growth by direct and a variety of indirect pathways.

It describes local deviations from average global conditions and is thus a proxy for spatial heterogeneity. Investigating instability in spatial variance is a useful way of detecting spatial boundaries, analysing the internal structure of spatial clusters and revealing simultaneously acting geographic phenomena. Recently, a corresponding test statistic called Local Spatial Heteroscedasticity' (LOSH) has been proposed. This test allows locally heterogeneous regions to be mapped and investigated by comparing them with the global average mean deviation in a data set. While this test is useful in stationary conditions, its value is limited in a global heterogeneous state. There is a risk that local structures might be overlooked and wrong inferences drawn. In this paper, we introduce a test that takes account of global spatial heterogeneity in assessing local spatial effects. The proposed measure, which we call Local Spatial Dispersion' (LSD), adapts LOSH to local conditions by omitting global information beyond the range of the local neighbourhood and by keeping the related inferential procedure at a local level. Thereby, the local neighbourhoods might be small and cause small-sample issues. In the view of this, we recommend an empirical Bayesian technique to increase the data that is available for resampling by employing empirical prior knowledge. The usefulness of this approach is demonstrated by applying it to a Light Detection and Ranging-derived data set with height differences and by making a comparison with LOSH. Our results show that LSD is uncorrelated with non-spatial variance as well as local spatial autocorrelation. It thus discloses patterns that would be missed by LOSH or indicators of spatial autocorrelation. Furthermore, the empirical outcomes suggest that interpreting LOSH and LSD together is of greater value than interpreting each of the measures individually. In the given example, local interactions can be statistically detected between variance and spatial patterns in the presence of global structuring, and thus reveal details that might otherwise be overlooked.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "Spatial analysis;spatial heterogeneity;spatial hypothesis testing;spatial non-stationarity;ETHNORACIAL DIVERSITY;BOUNDARY DETECTION;EDGE-DETECTION;HETEROGENEITY;REGRESSION;LANDSCAPE;HETEROSCEDASTICITY;AUTOCORRELATION;ECOLOGY;CLASSIFICATION", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Heidelberg Univ, Inst Geog, GISci Res Grp, Heidelberg, Germany\n[ 2 ]‎ Univ Salzburg, Dept Geoinformat Z GIS, Salzburg, Austria\n[ 3 ]‎ Harvard Univ, Ctr Geog Anal, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA\n[ 4 ]‎ Univ Cologne, Inst Geog, Cologne, Germany", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Computer Science; Geography; Physical Geography; Information Science & Library Science", "wos_categories": "Computer Science, Information Systems; Geography; Geography, Physical; Information Science & Library Science"}

Therefore, the location of the northern boundary of China's tropical zone has been one of the most controversial issues in the study of comprehensive physical regionalisation in China. This paper introduces developments in the study of the northern boundary of China's tropical zone, in which different scholars delimit the boundary with great differences based on different regionalisation objectives, indexes, and methods. The main divergence of opinion is found in different understandings of zonal vegetation, agricultural vegetation type, cropping systems, tropical soil type and tropical characteristics. In this study, we applied the GeoDetector model, which measures the spatial stratified heterogeneity, to validate the northern boundaries of the tropical zone delimited by six principal scholars. The results show that the mean q-statistic value of the higher latitude boundary delimited by Ren Mei'e is the largest (q=0.37), suggesting that, of the rival views, it best reflects the regional differences between China's tropical and subtropical zones, but it is not necessarily suitable for guiding the development of tropical agriculture. The mean values of the q-statistics of Zheng Du's line and Yu Xianfang's line around the Leizhou Peninsula at a lower latitude were smaller, at 0.10 and 0.08 respectively, indicating that the regional differences were smaller than those of Ren Mei'e's boundary.

However, most of the current research uses statistical methods in the mixed pixel to correct the ET or LE estimation error, and there is a lack of research from the perspective of the remote sensing model. The method of using frequency distributions or generalized probability density functions (PDFs), which is called the statistical-dynamical approach to describe the heterogeneity of land surface characteristics, is a good way to solve the problem. However, in attempting to produce an efficient PDF-based parameterization of remotely sensed ET or LE, first and foremost, it is necessary to systematically understand the variables that are most consistent with the heterogeneity (i.e., variability for a fixed target area or landscape, where the variation in the surface parameter value is primarily concerned with the PDF-based model) of surface turbulence flux. However, the use of PDF alone does not facilitate direct comparisons of the spatial variability of surface variables. To address this issue, the objective of this study is to find an indicator based on PDF to express variability of surface variables. We select the dimensionless or dimensional consistent coefficient of variation (CV), Gini coefficient and entropy to express variability. Based on the analysis of simulated data and field experimental data, we find that entropy is more stable and accurate than the CV and Gini coefficient for expressing the variability of surface variables.

Based on ground monitoring air quality data collected in 2015 in Chinese cities above the prefectural level, this study identifies the spatiotemporal variations of air pollution and its associated driving factors in China using descriptive statistics and geographical detector methods. The results show that the average air pollution ratio and continuous air pollution ratio across Chinese cities in 2015 were 23.1 +/- 16.9% and 16.2 +/- 14.8%. The highest levels of air pollution ratio and continuous air pollution ratio were observed in northern China, especially in the Bohai Rim region and Xinjiang province, and the lowest levels were found in southern China. The average and maximum levels of continuous air pollution show distinct spatial variations when compared with those of the continuous air pollution ratio. Monthly changes in both air pollution ratio and continuous air pollution ratio have a U-shaped variation, indicating that the highest levels of air pollution occurred in winter and the lowest levels happened in summer. The results of the geographical detector model further reveal that the effect intensity of natural factors on the spatial disparity of the air pollution ratio is greater than that of human-related factors. Specifically, among natural factors, the annual average temperature, land relief, and relative humidity have the greatest and most significant negative effects on the air pollution ratio, whereas human factors such as population density, the number of vehicles, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) witness the strongest and most significant positive effects on air pollution ratio.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "air pollution;spatiotemporal variations;driving factors;geographical detector;China;FINE PARTICULATE MATTER;SPATIAL-TEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS;LAND-USE REGRESSION;METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS;HAZE EVENTS;PM2.5;EXPOSURE;IMPACT;CITIES;QUALITY", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Reg Sustainable Dev Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Univ Illinois, Dept Geog & Geog Informat Sci, Urbana, IL 61801 USA\n[ 4 ]‎ Univ Utrecht, Dept Human Geog & Spatial Planning, POB 80125, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands\n[ 5 ]‎ Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Urbanizat & Geosimulat, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health", "wos_categories": "Environmental Sciences; Public, Environmental & Occupational Health"}

This paper reviews the applications and discusses future trends of BIM-GIS integration in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry based on the studies of 96 high-quality research articles from a spatio-temporal statistical perspective. The analysis of these applications helps reveal the evolution progress of BIM-GIS integration. Results show that the utilization of BIM-GIS integration in the AEC industry requires systematic theories beyond integration technologies and deep applications of mathematical modeling methods, including spatio-temporal statistical modeling in GIS and 4D/nD BIM simulation and management.

To precisely classify the environmental quality grades of farmland soil, additional samples may be required for multistage sampling or supplementary investigations.

Such classifications must use a sampling layout optimization method to distribute additional sampling units into areas with a high risk of misclassification. To resolve such problems, this paper provides an additional sampling layout optimization method that initially develops a classification error index by building a multi-Gaussian model with the predicted values and error variances of unsampled locations and then calculates the probability of a threshold value occurring in the standardized Gaussian distribution. The average error indexes of all locations in the study area are then set as the objectivity function of the additional sampling layout optimization, and the spatial simulated annealing is adopted to obtain the optimized sampling layout by minimizing the objectivity function. The performance of the error index sampling layout optimization method was demonstrated in a case study using chromium concentration data for HunanProvince, China. The results showed that the additional samples generated by the proposed method produce lower and more stable classification error rates than the minimization of the mean of the shortest distances and spatially random sample methods.

In this study we provided a perspective analysis of the changes of residential land prices in 2008, 2011 and 2014 based on the land price monitoring records of 105 cities and then conducted a geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis on the relationships between residential land price and three major impact factors (i.e., immigrant population, gross domestic product (GDP) and investment in residential buildings). Results show that the areas in which GDP had relatively strong positive impacts on residential land price expanded with time. The negative effects of immigrant population on residential land price were mainly concentrated in the cities around the Bohai Rim and the area with negative effects gradually shrank in the three studied years. Conversely, the areas with negative correlation between investment in residential buildings and residential land price gradually expanded in size over time. A geographical detector was used to examine the relative importance of factors to residential land price. It was found that the GDP had more significant influence on residential land price than other factors and the influence of the three factors to overall variation in residential land price increased over the three studied years.

This study proposes a novel unsupervised evaluation method to quantitatively measure the quality of segmentation results to overcome these problems. In this method, multiple spectral and spatial features of images are first extracted simultaneously and then integrated into a feature set to improve the quality of the feature representation of ground objects. The indicators designed for spatial stratified heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation are included to estimate the properties of the segments in this integrated feature set. These two indicators are then combined into a global assessment metric as the final quality score. The trade-offs of the combined indicators are accounted for using a strategy based on the Mahalanobis distance, which can be exhibited geometrically. The method is tested on two segmentation algorithms and three testing images. The proposed method is compared with two existing unsupervised methods and a supervised method to confirm its capabilities.

Although the real-time air quality report can be utilized to update our knowledge on air quality, questions about how pollutants evolve across time and how pollutants are spatially correlated still remain a puzzle. In view of this point, we adopt the PMFG network method to analyze the six pollutants' hourly data in 350 Chinese cities in an attempt to find out how these pollutants are correlated temporally and spatially. In terms of time dimension, the results indicate that, except for O-3, the pollutants have a common feature of the strong intraday patterns of which the daily variations are composed of two contraction periods and two expansion periods. Besides, all the time series of the six pollutants possess strong long- term correlations, and this temporal memory effect helps to explain why smoggy days are always followed by one after another. In terms of space dimension, the correlation structure shows that O-3 is characterized by the highest spatial connections. The PMFGs reveal the relationship between this spatial correlation and provincial administrative divisions by filtering the hierarchical structure in the correlation matrix and refining the cliques as the tinny spatial clusters. Finally, we check the stability of the correlation structure and conclude that, except for PM10 and O-3, the other pollutants have an overall stable correlation, and all pollutants have a slight trend to become more divergent in space.

In this paper, three estimators recommended in recent studies are compared using a single test dataset with known properties.The first estimator compared in this study (ST4) is based on post-stratification of the data. The second estimator (V08) is using a predetermined correction factor calculated from the spatial autocorrelation. The third estimator (MB) is a model based prediction calculated using values from the semivariogram. MB and ST4 were both found to be fairly accurate, while V08 consistently underestimated the variance in this study. V08 relies on the assumption that the autocorrelation structure in the dataset can be described using a particular exponential function. The most likely explanation of the weak result for V08 is that this assumption is violated by the empirical data used in the experiment.

Three hundred and sixty four (38%) cases occurred in Ar Riyad province, while 325 (34%) cases occurred in Makkah. Individuals with some comorbidity had a significantly higher likelihood of dying from MERS-CoV compared with those who did not suffer comorbidity [Odds ratio (OR) = 2.071; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.307, 3.263]. Health-care workers were significantly less likely to die from the disease compared with non-health workers [OR = 0.372, 95% CI: 0.151, 0.827]. Patients who had fatal clinical experience and those with clinical and subclinical experiences were equally less likely to die from the disease compared with patients who did not have fatal clinical experience and those without clinical and subclinical experiences respectively. The odds of dying from the disease was found to increase as age increased beyond 25 years and was much higher for individuals with any underlying comorbidities.ConclusionInterventions to minimize mortality from the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus should particularly focus individuals with comorbidity, non-health-care workers, patients with no clinical fatal experience, and patients without any clinical and subclinical experiences.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "BAYESIAN P-SPLINES;MERS-CORONAVIRUS;TRANSMISSION;DISEASE;CHINA;COV", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Qatar Univ, Dept Math Stat & Phys, Coll Arts & Sci, Doha 2713, Qatar\n[ 2 ]‎ Fed Univ Technol Akure, Dept Stat, Akure, Nigeria\n[ 3 ]‎ Qatar Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Coll Hlth Sci, Doha 2713, Qatar", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Science & Technology - Other Topics", "wos_categories": "Multidisciplinary Sciences"}

Objective The objective of this study was to perform a multi-scale geographical analysis of the period prevalence of VS in West Scotland from 2000 to 2015.MethodsAdults diagnosed with sporadic VS were identified through the National Health Services of West Scotland database and geocoded to the unit postcode. To assess whether the cohort of VS cases could be pooled into a period prevalence measure, the locations of VS cases were analyzed by sex using Cross-L and Difference-K functions. VS period prevalence was examined at two aggregate spatial scales: the postcode district and a coarser scale of NHS Health Boards. The spatial structure of period prevalence within each level of spatial aggregation was measured using univariate global and local Moran's I. Bivariate local Moran's I was used to examine the between-scale variability in period prevalence from the postcode district level to the NHS Health Boards levels. Prior to spatial autocorrelation analyses, the period prevalence at the postcode district was tested for stratified spatial heterogeneity within the NHS Health Boards using Wang's q-Statistic.ResultsA total of 512 sporadic VS were identified in a population of over 3.1 million. Between 2000 and 2015, VS period prevalence was highest within the NHS Health Boards of Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Ayrshire and Arran and the Western Isles. However, at the NHS scale, period prevalence exhibited no spatial autocorrelation globally or locally. At the district scale, Highland exhibited the most unusual local spatial autocorrelation. Bivariate local Moran's I results indicated general stability of period prevalence across the postcode district to Health Boards scales. However, locally, some postcode districts in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Ayrshire and Arran exhibited unusually low district to zone spatial autocorrelation in period prevalence, as did the southern parts of the Western Isles. Some unusually high period prevalence values between the postcode district to Health Board scale were found in Tayside, Forth Valley and Dumfries and Galloway.ConclusionGeographic variability in VS in West Scotland was identified in this patient population, showing that there are areas, even remote, with unusually high or low period prevalence. This can be partially attributed to links between primary and tertiary care. Potential genetic or environmental risk factors that may contribute to geographic variation in this disease within Scotland are also a possibility but require further investigation.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "ENVIRONMENTAL RISK-FACTORS;AREAL UNIT PROBLEM;QUALITY-OF-LIFE;ACOUSTIC NEUROMA;BRAIN-TUMORS;EPIDEMIOLOGY;ASSOCIATION;INDICATORS;HISTORY;SURGERY", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Univ Ottawa, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Ottawa, ON, Canada\n[ 2 ]‎ Ottawa Hosp, Ottawa, ON, Canada\n[ 3 ]‎ Univ Ottawa, Dept Geog Environm & Geomat, LAGGISS, Ottawa, ON, Canada\n[ 4 ]‎ Univ Saskatchewan, Undergrad Med Program, Saskatoon, SK, Canada\n[ 5 ]‎ Queen Elizabeth Univ Hosp, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Science & Technology - Other Topics", "wos_categories": "Multidisciplinary Sciences"}

First, we found that the precipitation trend rate in the Beibu Gulf Economic Zone is between -47 and 96 mm/10a. Second, forest coverage rate change (FCRC), urbanization rate change (URC), GDP change (GDPC) and population density change (PDC) have a larger contribution to precipitation change through land-surface feedback, which makes them the leading factors. Third, the human element is found to primarily account for the precipitation changes in this region, as humans are the active media linking and enhancing these impact factors.

Results revealed that the cropping intensity remarkably increased during 1982-1999 but slightly declined during 2001-2013. The overall cropping intensity increased from 1.34 in the 1980s to 1.41 in the 1990s, and then dropped to an average of 1.36 after 2000.

The present study proposed a novel approach that integrated ecological and case-control methods to quantify the risk of inapparent avian exposure on human H7N9 infection. Significant associations of the infection with chicken and goose densities, but not with duck density, were identified after adjusting for spatial clustering effects of the H7N9 cases across multiple geographic scales of neighborhood, community, district and city levels. These exposure risks varied geographically in association with proximity to rivers and lakes that were also proxies for inapparent exposure to avian-related environment.

A time-series Poisson regression model with a distributed lag non-linear model was used to estimate the prefecture-specific effects. A multivariate meta-analysis was applied to pooled estimates on a national level.Results: A total of 659,752 OHCA cases of presumed-cardiac origin met the inclusion criteria. The minimum morbidity percentile (MMP) was identified as the 84th percentile for temperature, ranging from 20.8 degrees C in Hokkaido to 28.8 degrees C in Okinawa. The overall pooled relative risk versus the MMP was 2.10 (95% CI: 1.84, 2.40) at extremely low temperatures (1st percentile) and 1.06 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.12) at extremely high temperatures (99th percentile). The effects of extremely high temperatures were acute and disappeared after a few days, while those of extremely low temperatures were also acute, but persisted for several days. The multivariate Cochran'sQ test indicated no heterogeneity between prefectures (p = 0.699; I-2 = 1.0%).Conclusions: Extreme temperatures are associated with an increased risk of OHCA. Timely prevention strategies might reduce the risk of OHCA during extreme temperatures. Several days prevention should be also implemented for extremely low temperatures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The traditional method of quantitative remote sensing model is not only sophisticated but also inaccurate to fetch the exact PM_(2.5) data near the ground. Though the built-up ground monitoring stations can now provide sufficient PM_(2.5) observation data with high sampling frequency, there still exist many extreme outliers due to inevitable observation noise. Therefore, in this study, we adopted Kalman filter for optimal estimation of time-series of air quality data in 338 cities of China and comprehensively analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution pattern during the period of 2015. In our detailed analysis, we used DTW based K-Medoids clustering to classify cities into 4 levels according to their contamination degree, and utilized q statistic technique to evaluate the spatial stratified heterogeneity of PM_(2.5). The results show that by using Kalman filter, noise can be effectively reduced and value of PSNR can be significantly improved. In the study of temporal distribution, we found that PM_(2.5) followed a 'U' curve in yearly temporal distributions while daily temporal distributions obeyed a 'W' curve.

Many previous studies have reported that human health risk is very sensitive to temperature and climate change was considered to be the most severe global health threat in the 21st century. Nowadays, the research on the impact of extreme temperature on public health has been a hotspot. Compared to those in developed countries, the related studies have started late in China. Moreover, there are three limitations in these studies. (1) Most of such studies focused only on one city or a few cities and the studies on the whole country are few.(2) The previous studies have not quantitatively identified the influence of temperature on health because the spatial scales were based on administrative regions, not on temperature zones. (3) Comparing with many studies on hot wave, relatively fewer are concerned with the influence of extreme low temperature. To overcome aforementioned problems, we collected the mortality dataset and meteorological variables of 127 communities in China during 2007 to 2012 from China Center for Disease Control and Prevention and pooled the community-specific cold risk in various latitude-effected temperature zones with the meta-analysis method. Then, we utilized the Distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) at community level to investigate temperature-mortality relationship in different temperature zones and calculated the relative risk (RR) of extreme low temperature on mortality. The results showed that although temperature-mortality curves at the community level appeared huge differences, the pooled curves were generally U-or J-shaped in these five zones. Temperature-mortality curves in three zones (the sub-temperate region, warm temperate region and north subtropical region) were all U-shaped, indicating both low and high temperatures could increase significantly mortality risk. Moreover, the curves appeared J-shaped in other two zones (the middle subtropical region and south subtropical region). The most significant cold effect was observed in middle subtropical, with a RR of 1.93 (95% CI: 1.08-3.60); while the cold effect in north subtropical was not so obvious, with a RR of 1.27 (95% CI: 0.94-1.72). Based on this, an M-shaped curve of the cold risk was found across Chinese mainland. This means the risks of cold-related mortality are high in warm temperature and middle subtropical zone, moderate in sub-temperate and south subtropical zone, and low in north subtropical zone. Low temperature does show significant impact on temperature-mortality risk, but considering the M-shaped risk curve, we believe social-economic factors should also be taken into consideration. To explain this phenomenon, we collected the social-economic data including population and GDP and found that the highest per capita GDP matched with the lowest cold-related risk, while the related lower per capita GDP matched with the highest cold-related risk. Based on these findings, different characteristics of mortality of cold stress highlighted that not only ambient temperature but also social-economic condition can be a main factor controlling health risk. Our findings also suggest that more adaptive and effective measures especially increasing investment on public health are necessary, especially for the middle subtropical zone, to reduce health risks in China.", "abstract_ch": "全球变暖导致气象灾害频发,尤其是极端天气事件。极端温度对公共健康的影响已成为当今研究的热点问题之一。相比于发达国家,中国在该领域研究起步较晚。虽然已有出色的成果,但在以下3个方面还略显不足:①大多数研究基于一个城市或几个城市,缺乏基于大量数据的区域尺度的研究;②已有研究往往按地理因素或行政单位来划分区域,而忽视区域内部温度的异质性;③相比高温热浪,鲜少有研究关注低温冷害的影响。针对上述问题,本文收集了中国疾病预防控制中心2007-2012年全国127个站点的数据,利用分布式滞后非线性模型,探究了中国5个温度带温度与居民非意外死亡之间的暴露-反应曲线。在此基础上,定义当地温度分布1%处的温度为极端低温,根据温度-死亡风险曲线,计算了冷害造成的死亡风险。结果表明,不同温度带的温度-死亡关系曲线呈现U型或J型。极端低温对北亚热带影响最小,其相对风险为1.27(95%CI: 0.94-1.72);对中亚热带影响最大,其相对风险为1.93(95%CI: 1.08-3.60)。随着温度带温度的升高,低温冷效应的影响呈现\"M\"型,这一特征与不同温度带经济发展有关。因此,不同地区的政府除了应着力提高地区经济发展外,还应根据地区特征,采取更积极有效的措施来应对低温冷害可能给当地公共健康造成的威胁。", "keywords_en": "temperature and public health; low temperature; DLNM model; climate change; spatial difference", "keywords_ch": "温度与公共健康; 低温; DLNM模型; 气候变化; 空间分异", "address_en": "Wang Chenzhi,State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resources Ecology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China.Zhang Zhao,State Key Laboratory of Earth Surface Processes and Resources Ecology, Beijing Normal University, Key Laboratory of Environmental Change and Natural Disaster, MOE, Beijing 100875, China.Zhou Maigeng,Surveillance Branch, National Center for Chronic and Non-communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, China.Yin Peng,Surveillance Branch, National Center for Chronic and Non-communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, China.Tao Fulu,Institute of Geographical Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Jin Yuexiong,Peoples Insurance Company of China Huzhou branch, Huzhou, Zhejiang 313000, China.", "address_ch": "王琛智,北京师范大学, 地表过程与资源生态国家重点实验室, 北京 100875, 中国.张朝,北京师范大学, 地表过程与资源生态国家重点实验室;;环境演变与自然灾害教育部重点实验室, 北京 100875, 中国.周脉耕,中国疾病预防控制中心慢性非传染性疾病预防控制中心, 北京 100050, 中国.殷鹏,中国疾病预防控制中心慢性非传染性疾病预防控制中心, 北京 100050, 中国.陶福禄,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 北京 100101, 中国.金月雄,中国人民财产保险股份有限公司湖州分公司, 湖州, 浙江 313000, 中国.", "research_areas": "Public, Environmental & Occupational Health", "wos_categories": ""}

In recent 40 years, a series of environmental and climatic issues such as degradation of Arctic natural environment, frequent extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere and global sea-level rise are caused by continuous warming and apparent sea ice decrease in Arctic. So it's important to know the extent, variation, trend of Arctic sea ice and its response to global climate change. The most commonly used datasets such as HadISST and OISST sea ice dataset provided long time series of changes in sea ice of the Arctic regions. However, the spatial resolution of these datasets is relatively low. There are some limits in the study of response of sea ice change in Arctic key regions to weather and climate in China. To overcome these problems and to make up the lack of passive microwave sea ice dataset provided by China, FY (Feng Yun) sea ice dataset is developed by NSMC (National Satellite Meteorological Center) on June 27th, 2011. In this dataset, the Enhanced NASA Team (NT2) algorithm is used based on the data of MWRI (Microwave Radiation Imager) sensor carried on FY satellite. In this algorithm, direct radiative transfer model is used to model MWRI brightness temperature for four surface types (ice-free ocean, new-formed ice, one-year ice and multi-years ice) and for different atmospheric conditions. Then, sea ice coverage lookup table (0% to 100% in 1% increments) is obtained based on modeled brightness temperature considering different atmospheric conditions. Sea ice coverage is confirmed by comparing observed value with modeled value. Sea ice extent is consistent with the actual situation in most Arctic regions. Although matching errors between channels and positioning errors have been corrected in FY dataset, the received echo signal is relatively weak due to the shorter antenna on MWRI. The weak echo signal makes it difficult to correctly differentiate the boundary between sea ice and near sea shore land, which greatly impact the total accuracy of the dataset and its application. In order to solve this problem, this study introduces a method of optimizing FY Arctic sea ice dataset based on NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Center) sea ice product. In NSIDC product, judgment matrix was created covering the entire grid and identifying each pixel as land, shore, near-shore, offshore or ocean as determined by the land/sea mask. Then, these different pixels are corrected in different degrees, respectively. Sea ice extent calculated from NSIDC product is strongly consistent to the actual situation. The accuracy of FY dataset is greatly improved. The analysis results indicated an extremely significantly positive correlation with the NSIDC product (R~2 = 0.9997) during June 27th, 2011-December 31st, 2015. The maximum deviation percent of daily, monthly and annually sea ice extent is 3.5%, 1.9% and 0.9%, respectively. Also, the optimization process of FY dataset has no obvious influence on the spatial stratified heterogeneity of the dataset. The optimized FY dataset can correctly reflect Arctic sea ice extent and its variation, especially in coastline regions. It can provide reliable basic data for the study of Arctic sea ice change.", "abstract_ch": "北极海冰对全球气候起着非常重要的调制作用,海冰范围是海冰监测的基本参数。近40年,北极地区持续变暖,北极海冰显著减少,进而引发北极自然环境恶化、北半球极端天气频发、全球海平面上升等一系列环境和气候问题。准确获取北极海冰范围及其演变趋势,确定海冰变化对全球气候系统的响应,是研究和预测全球气候变化趋势的关键之一。HasISST和OISST海冰数据集在海冰监测中应用最为广泛,可为北极地区长时间序列海冰变化研究提供基础数据,但这2套数据集空间分辨率相对较低,应用于北极关键区对中国气候响应研究方面存在很大的局限,为解决这一问题和弥补国内海冰监测微波遥感数据的空白,2011年6月27日,国家卫星气象中心(National Satellite Meteorological Center, NSMC)发布了FY(Fengyun, FY)北极海冰数据集,该数据集利用搭载在FY卫星上的微波成像仪(Microwave Radiation Imager, MWRI)数据,使用Enhance NASA Team算法制作,该算法利用前向辐射传输模型模拟北极地区4种海表类型(海水、新生冰、一年冰和多年冰)在不同大气条件下MWRI辐射亮温,进而得到每种大气条件下0~100%的海冰覆盖度查找表(海冰覆盖度每次增加1%),通过观测值与模拟值的比对得到海冰覆盖度,由该数据集计算得到的北极海冰范围在大部分区域与实际情况相符。该产品虽已进行通道间匹配误差修正和定位精度偏差订正,但由于其搭载的微波成像仪(Microwave Radiation Imager, MWRI)天线长度有限,造成传感器探测到的地物回波信号相对较弱,难以区分海冰和近岸附近的陆地,影响了该数据集的精度和应用。为解决这一问题,本文基于美国冰雪中心(National Snow and Ice Data Center, NSIDC)发布的海冰产品对FY海冰数据集进行优化,NSIDC产品利用判断矩阵对海岸线附近的像元进行识别,并对误差像元进行不同程度的修正,由NSIDC产品计算得到的北极海冰范围与实际情况更为符合。数据集优化大大提高了FY海冰数据集的精度,研究结果表明,优化后FY海冰数据集与NSIDC产品相关系数高达0.9997,且二者日、月、年平均最大海冰范围偏差仅为3.5%、1.9%、0.9%,且FY海冰数据集优化过程对其较好的空间分异特征无明显影响。该数据集可正确地反映北极海冰范围及其变化情况,且海岸线附近海冰的分布情况更准确,可为北极海冰变化研究提供可靠的基础数据。", "keywords_en": "sea ice dataset; FengYun(FY)-3B; remote sensing; Arctic; spatial stratified heterogeneity", "keywords_ch": "海冰数据集; 风云三号卫星; 遥感; 北极; 空间分异", "address_en": "Zhai Zhaokun,College of Geomatics, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Key Laboratory of Surveying and Mapping Technology on Island and Reef, State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping, Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, Qingdao, Shandong 266590, China.Lu Shanlong,Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, Key Laboratory of Digital Earth Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, Beijing 100101, China.Wang Ping,College of Geomatics, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Key Laboratory of Surveying and Mapping Technology on Island and Reef, State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping, Qingdao, Shandong 266590, China.Ma Lijuan,National Climate Center, National Satellite Meteorological Center, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100081, China.Li Duo,National Climate Center, National Satellite Meteorological Center, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100081, China.Ren Yuyu,National Climate Center, National Satellite Meteorological Center, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100081, China.Wu Shengli,National Climate Center, National Satellite Meteorological Center, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100081, China.", "address_ch": "翟召坤,山东科技大学测绘科学与工程学院, 海岛(礁)测绘技术国家测绘地理信息局重点实验室;;中国科学院数字地球重点实验室;;遥感科学国家重点实验室, 青岛, 山东 266590, 中国.卢善龙,中国科学院遥感与数字地球研究所, 中国科学院数字地球重点实验室;;遥感科学国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.王萍,山东科技大学测绘科学与工程学院, 海岛(礁)测绘技术国家测绘地理信息局重点实验室, 青岛, 山东 266590, 中国.马丽娟,国家气候中心,国家卫星气象中心,中国气象局, 北京 100081, 中国.李多,国家气候中心,国家卫星气象中心,中国气象局, 北京 100081, 中国.任玉玉,国家气候中心,国家卫星气象中心,中国气象局, 北京 100081, 中国.武胜利,国家气候中心,国家卫星气象中心,中国气象局, 北京 100081, 中国.", "research_areas": "Oceanography", "wos_categories": ""}

(2) The q average value of all indexes for the border was 0.40. Using this model, regionalization principles-homogeneity of the within-strata value and heterogeneity of the between- strata value-were satisfied.

Different from most previous research, this paper examined the differentiation and changes of population distribution on both sides of Hu Line from a perspective of spatial stratified heterogeneity instead. Geodetector was employed based on the spatial database of China's census data of 1953, 1982, 1990, 2000 and 2010 to reconfirm spatial position of Hu Line and analyzed changes of spatial stratified heterogeneity of population between southeast and northwest sides of Hu Line in different periods. Changes of population distribution since the founding of New China were found and the reasons for these changes were discussed. Major findings include: (1) From the spatial stratified heterogeneity perspective, Hu Line could be improved and optimized, at least, in some periods. Although the ratio of total population on both sides of Hu Line has roughly been kept at 94:6 since 1953, spatial stratified heterogeneity of population between the two sides (the southeastern side: the northwestern side) increased when Hu Line moves to south slightly in 1953, 2000 and 2010, which means population distribution was more homogeneous within either southeastern or northwestern region and heterogeneity was more remarkable between the two regions. (2) Heterogeneity decreased gradually since the reform and opening up. We found characteristics of population distribution converged on the two sides, especially since the 1990s when convergence between the two sides became apparent. This finding is significantly different from the conclusion of \"remain unchanged\" from most literatures. The reasons why heterogeneity reduced were: pattern of population distribution on the southeastern side changed from relatively even distribution among cities before 1990 to agglomeration in a few huge cities after 2000, while the degree of spatial agglomeration of population decreased slightly after the reform on the northwestern side. These changes have been confirmed by the analysis from cumulative distribution function and Gini coefficient. (3) On the whole, the effect of economic factors on population distribution has become more and more important, while the effect of natural environment and institution reduced. Combined effect from economic development, natural environment and institution resulted in two opposite directions of changes of population spatial distribution on the two sides. It should be emphasized that although general effect of natural environment has decreased, some natural factors, such as Three Gradient Terrains, still have significantly influence on population distribution in China.", "abstract_ch": "胡焕庸线作为人地关系的重要地理大发现之一,揭示了中国人口分布东密西疏的重要特征,是人文与经济地理学对社会的重要贡献之一。本文采用地理探测器等定量方法,以人口普查数据为基础,对胡焕庸线两侧人口分布的分异性特征进行了深入讨论,并尝试解释中国人口分布特征变化的原因及其机制。结果表明:①胡焕庸线作为中国最重要的人口分界线仍基本保持稳定,但从空间统计学分异特征来看该分界线仍可进一步优化调整;②胡焕庸线两侧内部人口集聚模式发生着明显变化,东南半壁人口分布由改革开放之前和初期的相对均衡状态,转变为以长三角、珠三角等少数区域为中心的集聚模式;而西北半壁人口分布的集聚程度则趋于下降;③从人口空间分布的影响因素看,尽管总体上,经济发展类因素对于人口空间分布影响不断增强,但三大阶梯等自然地理本底条件依然对中国人口分布有着重要影响。", "keywords_en": "Hu-Line; population distribution; spatial heterogeneity; agglomeration; dispersion; Geodetector", "keywords_ch": "胡焕庸线; 人口分布; 空间分异性; 集聚; 扩散; 地理探测器", "address_en": "Li Jiaming,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Lu Dadao,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Chen Mingxing,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Xu Chengdong,State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environment Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Li Yang,China Center for Modernization Research, CAS, Beijing 100190, China.", "address_ch": "李佳洺,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.陆大道,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.陈明星,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.徐成东,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.李扬,中国科学院中国现代化研究中心, 北京 100190, 中国.", "research_areas": "Sociology", "wos_categories": ""}

Using Xiamen City, China from 1996 to 2006 as a Case study, we explored the interactions between human activities and ecological factors, as well as their influences on urban forest LST.

We integrated multi-source data (forest inventory, digital elevation models (DM), population, and remote sensing imagery) to develop a database on a unified urban scale. The driving mechanism of urban forest LST was revealed through a combination of multi-source spatial data and spatial statistical analysis of clustering regions. The results showed that the main factors contributing to urban forest LST were dominant tree species and elevation. The interactions between human activity and specific ecological factors linearly or nonlinearly increased LST in urban forests. Strong interactions between elevation and dominant species were generally observed and were prevalent in either hot or cold spots areas in different years.

Different from most previous research, this paper examined the differentiation and changes of population distribution on both sides of Hu Line from a perspective of spatial stratified heterogeneity instead. Geodetector was employed based on the spatial database of China's census data of 1953, 1982, 1990, 2000 and 2010 to reconfirm spatial position of Hu Line and analyzed changes of spatial stratified heterogeneity of population between southeast and northwest sides of Hu Line in different periods. Changes of population distribution since the founding of New China were found and the reasons for these changes were discussed. Major findings include: (1) From the spatial stratified heterogeneity perspective, Hu Line could be improved and optimized, at least, in some periods. Although the ratio of total population on both sides of Hu Line has roughly been kept at 94:6 since 1953, spatial stratified heterogeneity of population between the two sides (the southeastern side: the northwestern side) increased when Hu Line moves to south slightly in 1953, 2000 and 2010, which means population distribution was more homogeneous within either southeastern or northwestern region and heterogeneity was more remarkable between the two regions. (2) Heterogeneity decreased gradually since the reform and opening up. We found characteristics of population distribution converged on the two sides, especially since the 1990s when convergence between the two sides became apparent. This finding is significantly different from the conclusion of \"remain unchanged\" from most literatures. The reasons why heterogeneity reduced were: pattern of population distribution on the southeastern side changed from relatively even distribution among cities before 1990 to agglomeration in a few huge cities after 2000, while the degree of spatial agglomeration of population decreased slightly after the reform on the northwestern side. These changes have been confirmed by the analysis from cumulative distribution function and Gini coefficient. (3) On the whole, the effect of economic factors on population distribution has become more and more important, while the effect of natural environment and institution reduced. Combined effect from economic development, natural environment and institution resulted in two opposite directions of changes of population spatial distribution on the two sides. It should be emphasized that although general effect of natural environment has decreased, some natural factors, such as Three Gradient Terrains, still have significantly influence on population distribution in China.", "abstract_ch": "胡焕庸线作为人地关系的重要地理大发现之一,揭示了中国人口分布东密西疏的重要特征,是人文与经济地理学对社会的重要贡献之一。本文采用地理探测器等定量方法,以人口普查数据为基础,对胡焕庸线两侧人口分布的分异性特征进行了深入讨论,并尝试解释中国人口分布特征变化的原因及其机制。结果表明:①胡焕庸线作为中国最重要的人口分界线仍基本保持稳定,但从空间统计学分异特征来看该分界线仍可进一步优化调整;②胡焕庸线两侧内部人口集聚模式发生着明显变化,东南半壁人口分布由改革开放之前和初期的相对均衡状态,转变为以长三角、珠三角等少数区域为中心的集聚模式;而西北半壁人口分布的集聚程度则趋于下降;③从人口空间分布的影响因素看,尽管总体上,经济发展类因素对于人口空间分布影响不断增强,但三大阶梯等自然地理本底条件依然对中国人口分布有着重要影响。", "keywords_en": "Hu-Line; population distribution; spatial heterogeneity; agglomeration; dispersion; Geodetector", "keywords_ch": "胡焕庸线; 人口分布; 空间分异性; 集聚; 扩散; 地理探测器", "address_en": "Li Jiaming,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Lu Dadao,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Chen Mingxing,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Xu Chengdong,State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environment Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Li Yang,China Center for Modernization Research, CAS, Beijing 100190, China.", "address_ch": "李佳洺,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.陆大道,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.陈明星,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.徐成东,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.李扬,中国科学院中国现代化研究中心, 北京 100190, 中国.", "research_areas": "Sociology", "wos_categories": ""}

Using Xiamen City, China from 1996 to 2006 as a Case study, we explored the interactions between human activities and ecological factors, as well as their influences on urban forest LST. Population density was selected as a proxy for human activity. We integrated multi-source data (forest inventory, digital elevation models (DM), population, and remote sensing imagery) to develop a database on a unified urban scale. The driving mechanism of urban forest LST was revealed through a combination of multi-source spatial data and spatial statistical analysis of clustering regions. The results showed that the main factors contributing to urban forest LST were dominant tree species and elevation. The interactions between human activity and specific ecological factors linearly or nonlinearly increased LST in urban forests. Strong interactions between elevation and dominant species were generally observed and were prevalent in either hot or cold spots areas in different years.

Climatic elements were used as dominant demarcation partitioning indexes, combined with auxiliary indexes such as soil and multiple cropping types. The key results were as follows: (1) Using Geodetector, the northern border of the tropical zone was delineated. From west to east, the border goes through Lincang, Simao, Yuxi and Gejiu in Yunnan, Baise, Mashan, Guigang and Wuzhou in Guangxi, Zhaoqing, Guangzhou, Huizhou, Heyuan and Meizhou in Guangdong, and Zhangzhou, Quanzhou and Putian in Fujian. It generally agrees with the 12℃ isotherm of the coldest monthly mean temperature, soil border between lateritic red soil and red soil, and border of double cropping rice or its continuous thermophile dry framing and single (double) cropping rice or its continuous chimonophilous dry framing. (2) The q average value of all indexes for the border was 0.40. Using this model, regionalization principles-homogeneity of the within-strata value and heterogeneity of the between- strata value-were satisfied. The border meets the requirements of zonal heterogeneity between tropical and subtropical zones. Therefore, it is reasonable to use Geodetector in studies of comprehensive physical regionalization, and it can provide high-precision technical support.", "abstract_ch": "热带北界一直是中国综合自然区划研究中争议较大的问题之一,不同学者基于不同区划指标和方法等划定的中国热带北界界线差异较大。基于空间分异性的综合自然区划思想,依托最新的基于统计学原理的地理探测器模型,以气候要素为主导指标,辅以土壤类型与作物熟制等,探讨中国陆地热带北界的界线。结果表明:①依据地理探测器模型所确定的中国陆地热带北界,自西向东依次经过滇、桂、粤和闽的临沧、思茅、玉溪、个旧、百色、马山、贵港、梧州、肇庆、广州、惠州、河源、梅州、漳州、泉州和莆田等地附近,其与最冷月均温12 ℃等温线、赤红壤与红壤界线及双季稻或双季稻连作喜温旱作与单(双)季稻连作喜凉旱作的分界线等基本吻合;②利用地理探测器确定的中国陆地热带北界新界线的各项指标决定力q值的均值为0.40,分异明显,满足层内同质性和层间异质性最大的区划原则,完全达到了热带与亚热带的区域空间异质性要求,其划分结果合理可信,表明地理探测器模型可为综合自然区划提供良好的技术支撑。", "keywords_en": "Geodetector; the northern border of tropical zone; comprehensive physical regionalization; China", "keywords_ch": "地理探测器; 陆地热带北界; 综合自然区划; 中国", "address_en": "Dong Yuxiang,Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Urbanization and Geo-simulation, School of Geography and Planning, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510275, China.Xu Qian,Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Urbanization and Geo-simulation, School of Geography and Planning, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510275, China.Yang Ren,Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Urbanization and Geo-simulation, School of Geography and Planning, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510275, China.Wang Yuying,Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Urbanization and Geo-simulation, School of Geography and Planning, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510275, China.Xu Chengdong,LREIS, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.", "address_ch": "董玉祥,中山大学地理科学与规划学院, 广东省城市化与地理环境空间模拟重点实验室, 广州, 广东 510275, 中国.徐茜,中山大学地理科学与规划学院, 广东省城市化与地理环境空间模拟重点实验室, 广州, 广东 510275, 中国.杨忍,中山大学地理科学与规划学院, 广东省城市化与地理环境空间模拟重点实验室, 广州, 广东 510275, 中国.王钰莹,中山大学地理科学与规划学院, 广东省城市化与地理环境空间模拟重点实验室, 广州, 广东 510275, 中国.徐成东,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 北京 100101, 中国.", "research_areas": "Geology", "wos_categories": ""}

Different from most previous research, this paper examined the differentiation and changes of population distribution on both sides of Hu Line from a perspective of spatial stratified heterogeneity instead. Geodetector was employed based on the spatial database of China's census data of 1953, 1982, 1990, 2000 and 2010 to reconfirm spatial position of Hu Line and analyzed changes of spatial stratified heterogeneity of population between southeast and northwest sides of Hu Line in different periods. Changes of population distribution since the founding of New China were found and the reasons for these changes were discussed. Major findings include: (1) From the spatial stratified heterogeneity perspective, Hu Line could be improved and optimized, at least, in some periods. Although the ratio of total population on both sides of Hu Line has roughly been kept at 94:6 since 1953, spatial stratified heterogeneity of population between the two sides (the southeastern side: the northwestern side) increased when Hu Line moves to south slightly in 1953, 2000 and 2010, which means population distribution was more homogeneous within either southeastern or northwestern region and heterogeneity was more remarkable between the two regions. (2) Heterogeneity decreased gradually since the reform and opening up. We found characteristics of population distribution converged on the two sides, especially since the 1990s when convergence between the two sides became apparent. This finding is significantly different from the conclusion of \"remain unchanged\" from most literatures. The reasons why heterogeneity reduced were: pattern of population distribution on the southeastern side changed from relatively even distribution among cities before 1990 to agglomeration in a few huge cities after 2000, while the degree of spatial agglomeration of population decreased slightly after the reform on the northwestern side. These changes have been confirmed by the analysis from cumulative distribution function and Gini coefficient. (3) On the whole, the effect of economic factors on population distribution has become more and more important, while the effect of natural environment and institution reduced. Combined effect from economic development, natural environment and institution resulted in two opposite directions of changes of population spatial distribution on the two sides. It should be emphasized that although general effect of natural environment has decreased, some natural factors, such as Three Gradient Terrains, still have significantly influence on population distribution in China.", "abstract_ch": "胡焕庸线作为人地关系的重要地理大发现之一,揭示了中国人口分布东密西疏的重要特征,是人文与经济地理学对社会的重要贡献之一。本文采用地理探测器等定量方法,以人口普查数据为基础,对胡焕庸线两侧人口分布的分异性特征进行了深入讨论,并尝试解释中国人口分布特征变化的原因及其机制。结果表明:①胡焕庸线作为中国最重要的人口分界线仍基本保持稳定,但从空间统计学分异特征来看该分界线仍可进一步优化调整;②胡焕庸线两侧内部人口集聚模式发生着明显变化,东南半壁人口分布由改革开放之前和初期的相对均衡状态,转变为以长三角、珠三角等少数区域为中心的集聚模式;而西北半壁人口分布的集聚程度则趋于下降;③从人口空间分布的影响因素看,尽管总体上,经济发展类因素对于人口空间分布影响不断增强,但三大阶梯等自然地理本底条件依然对中国人口分布有着重要影响。", "keywords_en": "Hu-Line; population distribution; spatial heterogeneity; agglomeration; dispersion; Geodetector", "keywords_ch": "胡焕庸线; 人口分布; 空间分异性; 集聚; 扩散; 地理探测器", "address_en": "Li Jiaming,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Lu Dadao,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Chen Mingxing,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Xu Chengdong,State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environment Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Li Yang,China Center for Modernization Research, CAS, Beijing 100190, China.", "address_ch": "李佳洺,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.陆大道,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.陈明星,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.徐成东,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.李扬,中国科学院中国现代化研究中心, 北京 100190, 中国.", "research_areas": "Sociology", "wos_categories": ""}

The driving mechanism of urban forest LST was revealed through a combination of multi-source spatial data and spatial statistical analysis of clustering regions. The results showed that the main factors contributing to urban forest LST were dominant tree species and elevation. The interactions between human activity and specific ecological factors linearly or nonlinearly increased LST in urban forests. Strong interactions between elevation and dominant species were generally observed and were prevalent in either hot or cold spots areas in different years.

Different from most previous research, this paper examined the differentiation and changes of population distribution on both sides of Hu Line from a perspective of spatial stratified heterogeneity instead. Geodetector was employed based on the spatial database of China's census data of 1953, 1982, 1990, 2000 and 2010 to reconfirm spatial position of Hu Line and analyzed changes of spatial stratified heterogeneity of population between southeast and northwest sides of Hu Line in different periods. Changes of population distribution since the founding of New China were found and the reasons for these changes were discussed. Major findings include: (1) From the spatial stratified heterogeneity perspective, Hu Line could be improved and optimized, at least, in some periods. Although the ratio of total population on both sides of Hu Line has roughly been kept at 94:6 since 1953, spatial stratified heterogeneity of population between the two sides (the southeastern side: the northwestern side) increased when Hu Line moves to south slightly in 1953, 2000 and 2010, which means population distribution was more homogeneous within either southeastern or northwestern region and heterogeneity was more remarkable between the two regions. (2) Heterogeneity decreased gradually since the reform and opening up. We found characteristics of population distribution converged on the two sides, especially since the 1990s when convergence between the two sides became apparent. This finding is significantly different from the conclusion of \"remain unchanged\" from most literatures. The reasons why heterogeneity reduced were: pattern of population distribution on the southeastern side changed from relatively even distribution among cities before 1990 to agglomeration in a few huge cities after 2000, while the degree of spatial agglomeration of population decreased slightly after the reform on the northwestern side. These changes have been confirmed by the analysis from cumulative distribution function and Gini coefficient. (3) On the whole, the effect of economic factors on population distribution has become more and more important, while the effect of natural environment and institution reduced. Combined effect from economic development, natural environment and institution resulted in two opposite directions of changes of population spatial distribution on the two sides. It should be emphasized that although general effect of natural environment has decreased, some natural factors, such as Three Gradient Terrains, still have significantly influence on population distribution in China.", "abstract_ch": "胡焕庸线作为人地关系的重要地理大发现之一,揭示了中国人口分布东密西疏的重要特征,是人文与经济地理学对社会的重要贡献之一。本文采用地理探测器等定量方法,以人口普查数据为基础,对胡焕庸线两侧人口分布的分异性特征进行了深入讨论,并尝试解释中国人口分布特征变化的原因及其机制。结果表明:①胡焕庸线作为中国最重要的人口分界线仍基本保持稳定,但从空间统计学分异特征来看该分界线仍可进一步优化调整;②胡焕庸线两侧内部人口集聚模式发生着明显变化,东南半壁人口分布由改革开放之前和初期的相对均衡状态,转变为以长三角、珠三角等少数区域为中心的集聚模式;而西北半壁人口分布的集聚程度则趋于下降;③从人口空间分布的影响因素看,尽管总体上,经济发展类因素对于人口空间分布影响不断增强,但三大阶梯等自然地理本底条件依然对中国人口分布有着重要影响。", "keywords_en": "Hu-Line; population distribution; spatial heterogeneity; agglomeration; dispersion; Geodetector", "keywords_ch": "胡焕庸线; 人口分布; 空间分异性; 集聚; 扩散; 地理探测器", "address_en": "Li Jiaming,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Lu Dadao,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Chen Mingxing,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Xu Chengdong,State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environment Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Li Yang,China Center for Modernization Research, CAS, Beijing 100190, China.", "address_ch": "李佳洺,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.陆大道,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.陈明星,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.徐成东,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.李扬,中国科学院中国现代化研究中心, 北京 100190, 中国.", "research_areas": "Sociology", "wos_categories": ""}

The driving mechanism of urban forest LST was revealed through a combination of multi-source spatial data and spatial statistical analysis of clustering regions. The results showed that the main factors contributing to urban forest LST were dominant tree species and elevation. The interactions between human activity and specific ecological factors linearly or nonlinearly increased LST in urban forests. Strong interactions between elevation and dominant species were generally observed and were prevalent in either hot or cold spots areas in different years.

This study used coastal environmental monitoring data from 15 sites (including COD, DIN, and PO4-P) to adequately analyze the water quality from 2009 to 2012 by applying the Trophic State Index. The monitoring network in Quanzhou Bay was evaluated and optimized, with the number of sites increased from 15 to 24, and the monitoring precision improved by 32.9%. The results demonstrated that the proposed advanced monitoring network optimization was appropriate for environmental monitoring in Quanzhou Bay.

Climatic elements were used as dominant demarcation partitioning indexes, combined with auxiliary indexes such as soil and multiple cropping types.

Different from most previous research, this paper examined the differentiation and changes of population distribution on both sides of Hu Line from a perspective of spatial stratified heterogeneity instead. Geodetector was employed based on the spatial database of China's census data of 1953, 1982, 1990, 2000 and 2010 to reconfirm spatial position of Hu Line and analyzed changes of spatial stratified heterogeneity of population between southeast and northwest sides of Hu Line in different periods. Changes of population distribution since the founding of New China were found and the reasons for these changes were discussed. Major findings include: (1) From the spatial stratified heterogeneity perspective, Hu Line could be improved and optimized, at least, in some periods. Although the ratio of total population on both sides of Hu Line has roughly been kept at 94:6 since 1953, spatial stratified heterogeneity of population between the two sides (the southeastern side: the northwestern side) increased when Hu Line moves to south slightly in 1953, 2000 and 2010, which means population distribution was more homogeneous within either southeastern or northwestern region and heterogeneity was more remarkable between the two regions. (2) Heterogeneity decreased gradually since the reform and opening up. We found characteristics of population distribution converged on the two sides, especially since the 1990s when convergence between the two sides became apparent. This finding is significantly different from the conclusion of \"remain unchanged\" from most literatures. The reasons why heterogeneity reduced were: pattern of population distribution on the southeastern side changed from relatively even distribution among cities before 1990 to agglomeration in a few huge cities after 2000, while the degree of spatial agglomeration of population decreased slightly after the reform on the northwestern side. These changes have been confirmed by the analysis from cumulative distribution function and Gini coefficient. (3) On the whole, the effect of economic factors on population distribution has become more and more important, while the effect of natural environment and institution reduced. Combined effect from economic development, natural environment and institution resulted in two opposite directions of changes of population spatial distribution on the two sides. It should be emphasized that although general effect of natural environment has decreased, some natural factors, such as Three Gradient Terrains, still have significantly influence on population distribution in China.", "abstract_ch": "胡焕庸线作为人地关系的重要地理大发现之一,揭示了中国人口分布东密西疏的重要特征,是人文与经济地理学对社会的重要贡献之一。本文采用地理探测器等定量方法,以人口普查数据为基础,对胡焕庸线两侧人口分布的分异性特征进行了深入讨论,并尝试解释中国人口分布特征变化的原因及其机制。结果表明:①胡焕庸线作为中国最重要的人口分界线仍基本保持稳定,但从空间统计学分异特征来看该分界线仍可进一步优化调整;②胡焕庸线两侧内部人口集聚模式发生着明显变化,东南半壁人口分布由改革开放之前和初期的相对均衡状态,转变为以长三角、珠三角等少数区域为中心的集聚模式;而西北半壁人口分布的集聚程度则趋于下降;③从人口空间分布的影响因素看,尽管总体上,经济发展类因素对于人口空间分布影响不断增强,但三大阶梯等自然地理本底条件依然对中国人口分布有着重要影响。", "keywords_en": "Hu-Line; population distribution; spatial heterogeneity; agglomeration; dispersion; Geodetector", "keywords_ch": "胡焕庸线; 人口分布; 空间分异性; 集聚; 扩散; 地理探测器", "address_en": "Li Jiaming,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Lu Dadao,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Chen Mingxing,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Xu Chengdong,State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environment Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Li Yang,China Center for Modernization Research, CAS, Beijing 100190, China.", "address_ch": "李佳洺,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.陆大道,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.陈明星,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.徐成东,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.李扬,中国科学院中国现代化研究中心, 北京 100190, 中国.", "research_areas": "Sociology", "wos_categories": ""}

Different from most previous research, this paper examined the differentiation and changes of population distribution on both sides of Hu Line from a perspective of spatial stratified heterogeneity instead. Geodetector was employed based on the spatial database of China's census data of 1953, 1982, 1990, 2000 and 2010 to reconfirm spatial position of Hu Line and analyzed changes of spatial stratified heterogeneity of population between southeast and northwest sides of Hu Line in different periods. Changes of population distribution since the founding of New China were found and the reasons for these changes were discussed. Major findings include: (1) From the spatial stratified heterogeneity perspective, Hu Line could be improved and optimized, at least, in some periods. Although the ratio of total population on both sides of Hu Line has roughly been kept at 94:6 since 1953, spatial stratified heterogeneity of population between the two sides (the southeastern side: the northwestern side) increased when Hu Line moves to south slightly in 1953, 2000 and 2010, which means population distribution was more homogeneous within either southeastern or northwestern region and heterogeneity was more remarkable between the two regions. (2) Heterogeneity decreased gradually since the reform and opening up. We found characteristics of population distribution converged on the two sides, especially since the 1990s when convergence between the two sides became apparent. This finding is significantly different from the conclusion of \"remain unchanged\" from most literatures. The reasons why heterogeneity reduced were: pattern of population distribution on the southeastern side changed from relatively even distribution among cities before 1990 to agglomeration in a few huge cities after 2000, while the degree of spatial agglomeration of population decreased slightly after the reform on the northwestern side. These changes have been confirmed by the analysis from cumulative distribution function and Gini coefficient. (3) On the whole, the effect of economic factors on population distribution has become more and more important, while the effect of natural environment and institution reduced. Combined effect from economic development, natural environment and institution resulted in two opposite directions of changes of population spatial distribution on the two sides. It should be emphasized that although general effect of natural environment has decreased, some natural factors, such as Three Gradient Terrains, still have significantly influence on population distribution in China.", "abstract_ch": "胡焕庸线作为人地关系的重要地理大发现之一,揭示了中国人口分布东密西疏的重要特征,是人文与经济地理学对社会的重要贡献之一。本文采用地理探测器等定量方法,以人口普查数据为基础,对胡焕庸线两侧人口分布的分异性特征进行了深入讨论,并尝试解释中国人口分布特征变化的原因及其机制。结果表明:①胡焕庸线作为中国最重要的人口分界线仍基本保持稳定,但从空间统计学分异特征来看该分界线仍可进一步优化调整;②胡焕庸线两侧内部人口集聚模式发生着明显变化,东南半壁人口分布由改革开放之前和初期的相对均衡状态,转变为以长三角、珠三角等少数区域为中心的集聚模式;而西北半壁人口分布的集聚程度则趋于下降;③从人口空间分布的影响因素看,尽管总体上,经济发展类因素对于人口空间分布影响不断增强,但三大阶梯等自然地理本底条件依然对中国人口分布有着重要影响。", "keywords_en": "Hu-Line; population distribution; spatial heterogeneity; agglomeration; dispersion; Geodetector", "keywords_ch": "胡焕庸线; 人口分布; 空间分异性; 集聚; 扩散; 地理探测器", "address_en": "Li Jiaming,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Lu Dadao,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Chen Mingxing,Key Laboratory of Regional Sustainable Development Modeling, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Xu Chengdong,State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environment Information System, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, CAS, Beijing 100101, China.Li Yang,China Center for Modernization Research, CAS, Beijing 100190, China.", "address_ch": "李佳洺,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.陆大道,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.陈明星,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 中国科学院区域可持续发展与模拟重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.徐成东,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.李扬,中国科学院中国现代化研究中心, 北京 100190, 中国.", "research_areas": "Sociology", "wos_categories": ""}

The driving mechanism of urban forest LST was revealed through a combination of multi-source spatial data and spatial statistical analysis of clustering regions. The results showed that the main factors contributing to urban forest LST were dominant tree species and elevation. The interactions between human activity and specific ecological factors linearly or nonlinearly increased LST in urban forests. Strong interactions between elevation and dominant species were generally observed and were prevalent in either hot or cold spots areas in different years.

Then, we explored the spatial and temporal clustering of the incidence of bacillary dysentery by using hotspot analysis model. We also investigated the quantitative relationship between the incidence of bacterial dysentery and the social-economic factors by using geographical detector model. The results showed that: (1) the peak attack time of bacillary dysentery was August. The age range that had the highest incidence was 0-9 years old, followed by those above 80 years old. The population that had the highest incidence was farmers, followed by the scattered children. (2) The incidence of bacterial dysentery clustered in both space and time in Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region. In space, the high clustering regions for incidence of bacillary dysentery are mainly located in Fangshan District and Mentougou District of Beijing and Binhai New Area of Tianjin;the low clustering regions are mainly located in Luan county of Tangshan. In time, the disease occurred in all the 12 months in 2012 in the high clustering regions, but mainly occurred in January, February, March, April and June in the low clustering regions. (3) The major socio-economic factors affecting the spatial distribution of incidence of bacterial dysentery included the proportion of rural population, population density and per capita GDP of each district or county, which explanatory power was 61%, 37% and 20%, respectively. The interactive effects were stronger than their individual effects. This study analyzed the population characteristics, spatial and temporal characteristics and influencing factors of incidence of bacillary dysentery in Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region and provided a theoretical basis for the prevention and control of bacterial dysentery in these regions.", "abstract_ch": "细菌性痢疾是常见疾病,也是备受关注的公共健康问题。近年来,京津唐地区的细菌性痢疾发病率相对较高。本文首先分析了2012年京津唐地区细菌性痢疾的季节性和人群特征;其次,使用热点分析模型,探索了京津唐地区细菌性痢疾发病率的时空聚集性;最后,运用地理探测器模型研究了细菌性痢疾的发生和社会经济因素之间的量化关系。结果表明:①细菌性痢疾发病的峰值时间是8月;发病率最高的年龄段是0-9岁,其次是80岁以上;农民群体发病率最高,其次是散居儿童。②京津唐地区细菌性痢疾在空间和时间上都存在聚集性。空间上,细菌性痢疾发病率的高聚集区主要分布于北京市的房山区及门头沟区和天津市的滨海新区,低聚集区主要分布于唐山市的滦县,时间上,细菌性痢疾发病率的高聚集区在12个月均有发生,低聚集区主要发生在1-4月以及6月。③影响细菌性痢疾发病率空间分布的主要社会经济因素为农村人口占总人口的比例、人口密度和各区县的人均GDP,它们的解释力分别为61%,37%和20%,并且发现它们的交互作用都大于独自影响的作用。本研究通过对京津唐地区细菌性痢疾发病情况的人群特征、时空特征以及影响因素的分析,为本地区细菌性痢疾的预防和控制提供理论依据。", "keywords_en": "GeoDetector; bacillary dysentery; socio-economic factors; spatial-temporal distribution", "keywords_ch": "地理探测器; 细菌性痢疾; 社会经济因素; 时空分布", "address_en": "Li Yuanyuan,The School of Earth Science and Resources, Chang′an University, State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710054, China.Xu Chengdong,Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information System, Beijing 100101, China.Xiao Gexin,China National Center for Food Safety Risk Assessment, Beijing 100022, China.Luo Guangxiang,The School of Earth Science and Resources, Chang′an University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710054, China.", "address_ch": "李媛媛,长安大学地球科学与资源学院, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 西安, 陕西 710054, 中国.徐成东,中国科学院地理科学与资源研究所, 资源与环境信息系统国家重点实验室, 北京 100101, 中国.肖革新,国家食品安全风险评估中心, 北京 100022, 中国.罗广祥,长安大学地球科学与资源学院, 西安, 陕西 710054, 中国.", "research_areas": "General & Internal Medicine", "wos_categories": ""}

However, coastal environmental monitoring work faces many problems and challenges, including the fact that monitoring information cannot be linked up with evaluation, monitoring data cannot well reflect the current coastal environmental condition, and monitoring activities are limited by cost constraints. For these reasons, protection and management measures cannot be developed and implemented well by policy makers who intend to solve this issue. In this paper, Quanzhou Bay in southeastern China was selected as a case study; and the Kriging method and a geographic information system were employed to evaluate and optimize the existing monitoring network in a semienclosed bay. This study used coastal environmental monitoring data from 15 sites (including COD, DIN, and PO4-P) to adequately analyze the water quality from 2009 to 2012 by applying the Trophic State Index. The monitoring network in Quanzhou Bay was evaluated and optimized, with the number of sites increased from 15 to 24, and the monitoring precision improved by 32.9%. The results demonstrated that the proposed advanced monitoring network optimization was appropriate for environmental monitoring in Quanzhou Bay. It might provide technical support for coastal management and pollutant reduction in similar areas.", "abstract_ch": "", "keywords_en": "MEDAKA ORYZIAS-LATIPES;WATER;ESTUARINE;MANAGEMENT;POLLUTION;PROGRAM;SEA;INFORMATION;PHOSPHORUS;FOOTPRINT", "keywords_ch": "", "address_en": "[ 1 ]‎ Xiamen Univ, Coastal & Ocean Management Inst, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China\n[ 2 ]‎ Xiamen Univ, Fujian Prov Key Lab Coastal Ecol & Environm Studi, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China\n[ 3 ]‎ Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China\n[ 4 ]‎ Xiamen Univ, Coll Ocean & Earth Sci, Xiamen 361102, Peoples R China\n[ 5 ]‎ Monitoring Ctr Marine Environm & Fishery Resource, Fuzhou 350003, Fujian Province, Peoples R China", "address_ch": "", "research_areas": "Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Research & Experimental Medicine", "wos_categories": "Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Medicine, Research & Experimental"}
